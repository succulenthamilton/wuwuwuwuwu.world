				This thesis evaluates contemporary lifestyle models, where the effects of living online cross-contaminate our
				physical lives, forming a hybrid experience in new spaces where the image is the primary form of communication
				with others and our own selves. It disputes the currently popular media representation of online life as inauthentic
				and asocial, instead accepting it as a new environment in which humanity adapts and flourishes. This work also
				optimistically presents the opportunities we have to subvert commercial spaces for our own creative and culturally
				productive interests.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ultimately, this book aims to represent our time online not as bizarre technological phenomenona, but as manifestations
				of the same psychological desires we have always grappled with in our social history, projected onto new spaces. From
				the perspective of an artist as well as a digital native, I evaluate digital cultures as made of highly developed and
				self-aware communities, with the potential to shift our society from the spectacular to the fantastic: where we can cohabitate
				and thrive in multiple, interconnected realities.

			<p>
				The position of this book is situated in a timespan between 2013 and 2014, about 10 years after Facebook was launched,
				8 after Twitter, and 7 after Tumblr. That’s about 16 years after AOL Instant Messaging, 13 years after the first version
				of Google Images, and 6 after the first iPhone. I was born in 1989, part of the generation that the media previously liked
				to call “Generation Y” but is now more inclined to call “Millenials” or “digital natives.”
			</p>
			<p>
				My generation is one of natives to a digital landscape where much of our adolescence and development has come from time
				spent online rather than in backyards or parks or elsewhere. They &mdash; as in the media and its representatives &mdash; like to write
				about me and the seemingly alienated way I live. They scold me for my lack of commitment to a career and to relationships,
				and for my constant use of electronic devices. Everything rooted in analog traditions and physical presence, they say, is going
				to shit.

			</div>

			<p>
				Throughout history, as we have seen with television, cell phones, and even the telegram, the invention of new,
				communication-based technologies has always been met with controversy. The conversations circulating around digital
				technologies and what they do to us are common, even trendy, but the majority of them miss what is really going on. No
				one spends time online alone. We are all online because we desire to consume, and that urge has gradually transformed
				and blended in with the want to produce. Inevitably what will happen when you have a group consuming and a group producing
				is the creation of culture, or rather, a massive collection of cultures. Though they are physically dispersed and mostly
				virtual (and here I mean virtual as computer-generated, not cheap simulation), they are nonetheless cultures that evoke lasting
				effects on the communities they inhabit. And though we may use the Internet separately and individually, today’s commercial
				web, one populated by social media networks and special interest sites, depends on culture and the perpetuation of certain
				lifestyles to keep it going: your connection and involvement with others is no longer just a possibility but an assumption,
				whether it is part of the online mainstream or not.
			</p>
			<p>
				Digital culture is, of course, too vast for one book to explain. The portion I will examine is where I spend much of my own
				life, rooted in my online experiences in the past leading up to now: starting with the Geocities homepage, to Livejournal,
				to the multiplicities of personality on Facebook, Tumblr, and Twitter. The majority of my experience as digital native is
				spent on sites where personal content and sharing is used to project an identity and communicate with others. While I use
				specific case studies, they provide the basis for how we deal with our now hybrid physical-virtual existences in which
				appropriated content and constant streams of data are the predominant structures for our daily lives. Here, my defining
				lack of commitment to either objective observer or generational guinea pig will provide the setting for the potential shifts
				in our shared value judgments that arise from our lives spent online.

		<div id="01" class="title">DEFINING TECHNOLOGY DEFINES OURSELVES</div>
			<p>
				It is difficult to begin a discussion regarding the Internet without first addressing current attitudes concerning
				technology in general.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, it must be established that I neither support nor dispute any arguments about the potentials or perils of any
				device or application. Many technologies have been met with both utopian optimism and cynical rejection. That is not
				something that applies exclusively to the Internet and our contemporary methods of digital consumption.
			</p>
			<p>
				That is also why arguments about whether the Internet is “good” or “bad” for you and the resulting attempts to quantify
				“healthy” levels of use and attention are, while not without merit and good intentions, becoming clichéd, and as I will
				discuss later, perhaps not completely free of more capitalistic intentions.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is obvious that too much of almost anything becomes a “bad” thing. What I am more concerned about is the cultural
				reasoning around why, when, and how a certain quantity or way of using the Internet becomes “bad” and who decides that.
				And if we look into that reasoning and how we exist on the Internet &mdash; how we really live on and with the Internet &mdash; then
				these interactions can be viewed as integral parts of our characters, not only behaviors that are strange or narcissistic
				or profit-driven. I do not mean to say that the Internet is free from harm or dangers, but that like any other environment,
				has qualities that we embody and incorporate into ourselves just as we do in our physical lives.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why I would like to begin with a redefinition of the elements that we are dealing with and how they are already
				integrated into our experiences. Many of these definitions are based on the writings of Vilém Flusser, who I find to be
				particularly influential for his attitudes regarding media theory. His historical placement during the ‘70s and ‘80s when
				computer technologies were just starting to show their full force uniquely situates him to comment on impending changes to
				our worldviews and how we can come to understand them as part of the new “utopia” that arises, one that as Flusser says,
				already in us.

		<div id="02" class="title">technology is our nature</div>
			<p class="quote">
				<span class="highlight">All human activity depends upon an imputed background whose content is rarely questioned: it is there because
				it is there.</span> It is the surface on which life floats. At one time, the bulk of this background would have
				consisted of entities which existed in a ‘natural order,’ all the way from the vagaries of the surface of the
				earth through to the touch of currents of air or the itch of various forms of clothing through to the changes
				in the sky. <span class="highlight">But over time, this background has been filled with more and more ‘artificial’ components until, at
				the present conjuncture, much of the background of life is ‘second nature’; the artificial equivalent of
				breathing.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="source">Nigel Thrift, <i>Non-Representational Theory</i> (91).</p>

			<p>
				To begin, I find the dualities in the definitions of “nature” and “technology” to be strangely rooted in connotations that
				both mirror and inhibit our thinking surrounding digital life. Often these two terms are used in opposition to one another:
				technology is the result of the human hand, the inventions created by us to enhance our lives. Nature, on the other hand, is
				an entity that supposedly exists outside of technology, wild and organic, untouched by humans.
			</p>
			<p>
				Already these definitions, at least in their context of use in American English, contain contradictory dualities. Nature is
				used as both the wild, untamed state of nature, as well as our innate, inescapable, inner nature. Sometimes nature is outside:
				sometimes it is within. In both cases there is a side that is pure, clean, and organic, but also one that is dirty, dark, and
				dangerous. This duality is also present in our conceptions of technology, at times a sparkling vision of the good life for all,
				yet always casting a dystopian shadow: what happens when technology goes rogue, when it turns on its creators and completely
				eliminates all that is, dare I say, natural?
			</p>
			<p>
				As Nigel Thrift notes, there is a background layer to our world that we do not question. Whereas in the distant past this layer
				was a natural ecosystem, nowadays that environment has become what Thrift calls “artificial”: for example, the walls of an
				apartment building with electricity and water, within a city with various inbuilt infrastructures. Our “second nature” is an
				environment built completely from technologies that now enable us to live our daily lives. Our environments are built from
				concrete and plastic. An alarm wakes us, we open our eyes and check our e-mail. For many that motion is now an instinctive,
				automatic reaction. Just as birds know when to migrate south for winter, the creation and adjustment to new technologies is
				more of an intuitive mutation than it is a spontaneous phenomenon.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is no longer just our physical environments that have changed. Our new, “artificial” second nature is not only a product of
				changing environments, but also a product of new ways of visualization and communication. Our understanding of the world affects
				us just as much as the objects that exist in space. And so, when we consider our state of nature nowadays, where we are constantly
				communicating and gathering information through the Internet, how do our perceptions of the world change? As our exposure to these
				technologies is primarily visual, I believe that the key to our understanding digital life is in the image.
			</p>

		<div id="03" class="title">Seeing is believing</div>
			<p class="quote">
				The loss of touch as a conceptual component of vision meant the unloosening of the eye from the network of
				referentiality incarnated in tacility and its subjective relation to perceived space. <span class="highlight">This autonomization
				of sight, occurring in many different domains, was a historical condition for the rebuilding of an observer
				fitted for the tasks of ‘spectacular’ consumption. Not only did the empirical isolation of vision allow its
				quantification and homogenization but it also enabled the new objects of vision (whether commodities,
				photographs, or the act of perception itself) to assume a mystified and abstract identity, sundered from any
				relation to the observer’s position within a cognitively unified field.</span>
			</p>

			<p class="source">Jonathan Crary, <i>Techniques of the Observer</i> (19).</p>

			<p>
				In the early ‘70s, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzkMo45pcUo" target="_blank">Colin Blakemore conducted several
				experiments where kittens between three weeks and three months of age were exposed to only horizontal lines</a>. He was
				testing theories of neuroplasticity in the visual cortex. In other words, he wanted to see if neural connections in the brain
				trained on one type of environment could adapt to a new one.
			</p>

			<div class="right">
				<iframe width="300" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QzkMo45pcUo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			</div>

			<p>
				When the kittens are finally exposed to a normal environment, some obvious survival reactions are missing: when exposed to
				ledges or sudden movements towards them, they show no reaction where a normal kitten would usually reach out or flinch. Due to
				neuroplasticity, these symptoms eventually disappear after the kitten continues to live in a normal environment. However, even
				after a longer period of time, we see that the kittens’ sensitivity to vertical lines is less developed than usual. The result
				is that these kittens are much more prone to walking into vertical structures in relation to a control group of normal kittens.
			</p>

			<p>
				Like cats, humans are largely visual creatures. This is made clear by our three-dimensional depth perception and relatively
				well-developed sense of color. As we see in the Blakemore experiment, while we are physiologically equipped for these aspects
				of vision, a lot of important visual information is learned from the environment and not built in. So the question is, what
				happens when we live in a so-called second nature dominated largely by time spent looking at two-dimensional screens? Because
				we are really visual creatures, the consequences of the spectacle as predicted by Debord in the ‘60’s are made only more complex
				by the intensification of image proliferation and accessibility made possible by technology. No doubt there is some correlation
				between Blakemore’s studies on neuroplasticity, how we learn to see culturally, and which of those visions are permanent.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Jonathan Crary argues, we have already learned to see much differently than before. Whereas sight and touch used to be
				integrated, we have since then separated the senses by using quantitative measurements to establish grounds for a basis of
				so-called normal vision, and further exacerbating that separation through the development of visual technologies. Whereas Crary
				and Walter Benjamin find the consequence to be a descent into pure spectatorship, by understanding the nature of the contemporary
				“image” and how we see and integrate them into our world views, we can begin to see how our acclimation to online spaces has
				allowed us to negate its spectacular qualities and gain a new form of visual autonomy.

			<p class="quote">
				<span class="highlight">When images supplant texts, we experience, perceive, and value the world and ourselves differently, no longer in a
				one-dimensional, linear, process-oriented, historical way but rather a two-dimensional way, as surface, context, scene.
				And our behavior changes: it is no longer dramatic but embedded in fields of relationships. What is currently happening is a
				mutation of our experiences, perceptions, values, and modes of behavior, a mutation of our being-in-the-world.</span>
			</p>

			<p class="source">Vilém Flusser, <i>Into the Universe of Technical Images</i> (5).</p>

			<p>
				When I speak of gaining autonomy of vision, in no way do I mean that we should go back to any “prehistoric” or “pure” way of
				seeing. It is not a matter of cleansing or reducing. A technology that becomes ubiquitous is like a cultural mutation, and as
				if by genetics, once it is inherited, it is difficult to go back to a clean slate. The power of images will not wane anytime
				soon, and because of that, we have to understand the problems of the technical image as they relate to our cultures and worldviews.
				However, the traditional notion of the “image” is no longer adequate to describe its present function.
			</p>

			<p>
				In his book <i>Towards a Philosophy of Photography</i>, Vilém Flusser argues that throughout human history, we have met a
				series of historical crises, in which images were used to rectify them. Basically, in order to understand our world we needed
				images to help decode and translate it. However, a problem arises when we become too dependent on them. That is, instead of using
				images to decode the world, they become its representation:
			<p>

			<p class="quote">
				Images are mediations between the world and human beings. Human beings ‘exist’, i.e. the world is not immediately accessible
				to them and therefore images are needed to make it comprehensible. <span class="highlight">However, as soon as this happens, images come between the
				world and human beings. They are supposed to be maps but they turn into screens: Instead of representing the world, they obscure
				it until human beings’ lives finally become a function of the images they create.</span> Human beings cease to decode the images and
				instead project them, still encoded, into the world ‘out there’, which meanwhile itself becomes like an image &mdash; a context of
				scenes, of states of things. (9-10)
			</p>

			<p>
				The problem of decoding the image arises because of what Flusser calls “magic.” All images contain magic because they are
				superficial: they have a surface that contains scenes that are understood by reading into the significance of its elements in
				relation to each other. Traditional images (those drawn by the human hand) are necessarily embedded with the intent of the
				creator, forcing the viewer to interpret them based on a set of culturally known structures. In religious imagery for example,
				there are often symbols that signify some meaning not apparent if the image were to be read purely at a surface level. We
				understand these meanings because of the context of where the image is, who created it, who commissioned it, and a broader
				knowledge of its subject matter. This nonlinear process of scanning the image, relating its parts to its whole, is its magic.
			</p>

			<div id="magicCycle" class="right">&nbsp;</div>

			<p>
				The danger is then when we stop being interpreting as a magical scene and instead as a representative one. Like Blakemore’s
				kittens, we become disoriented by the image if we are trained on it for too long. The world that we see becomes the image,
				and as we change our perception, values, and behavior to fit our image-world, we mold the world to suit the image. It is this
				cyclical, self-perpetuating feedback that is responsible for Debord’s spectacular society.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even more confusing, an “image” is not limited to a singular, two-dimensional object. Images can layer together to form other,
				larger entities that become an images in themselves. In the same way the layering of pieces of clothing creates an overall
				aesthetic image of a person, online platforms allow everyone to layer content to create a singular, magical image at a particular
				URL. This type of image is only one form of the contemporary technical image.
			</p>

			<div id="05" class="title">The Technical Image</div>

			<p class="quote">
				Ontologically, traditional images are abstractions of the first order insofar as they abstract from the concrete world
				while technical images are abstractions of the third order: <span class="highlight">They abstract from texts which abstract from traditional images
				which themselves abstract from the concrete world.</span> (14)
			</p>

			<p>
				In the world we live in now, we do not exist within traditional images so much as we exist within what Flusser calls
				“technical images.” According to Flusser, the first time images supplanted the world, we invented “linear writing” to decode
				them. At some point linear writing bore conceptual thinking, which abstracted the world once again. Technical images were
				created to help us decode the now abstracted texts. Once computers were invented, people were able to use them to create technical
				images that once again made these texts easier to understand using automatically rendered charts, graphics, and photographs.
			</p>

			<p>
				The move between these mediations &mdash; traditional image to linear text to technical image &mdash; reveal the steps between “universes”
				of interpreting the concrete world.<sup>1</sup> At its core is our perception of the environment, and the ability to temporarily suspend its
				immediacy by manipulating relationships through the use of technology. For example, humanity’s move from nomadic hunting and
				gathering to agricultural settlement is one example of suspension. Agricultural success can only be achieved through the
				comprehension of relationships, which were first recorded through traditional images. As explained before, the traditional
				image contains magic which must be read and re-interpreted in order for the viewer to enact that magic on the environment.
				In this specific example, this would be the act of reenacting the recorded models onto this year’s fields. The problem with
				traditional images in this case, is that their two-dimensionality makes them unsuitable for what Flusser calls “grasping,” a
				translation of the magic which depends on context and scene, into a linear progression that can be easily interpreted and
				executed.<sup>2</sup> Thus linear texts were created to aid this process: planting instructions, field guides, explanations,
				calculations, and narratives all work in this way.
			</p>

			<div class="right">
				<span id="footnote">
					1 Flusser, <i>Into the Universe of Technical Images</i> (8).<br/><br/>
					2 <i>Into the Universe of Technical Images</i> (9).
				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				The primary change we see with the creation of linear texts is the invention and recording of “history,” which Flusser defines
				only in terms of periods recorded by linear texts. The problem with this linear universe he claims, is that the effectiveness of
				these texts relative to magical traditional images has occluded the concrete world entirely, leading us to continue abstracting our
				perceptions of the environment based on historical periods of abstractions. Our recordings of the fields ceased to be based on what
				we saw, but on what we recorded before. Now in this current universe of technical images, we are trying to repair the jumble of
				“particles” into another mediation which allows us to understand our environment once again through calculations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Flusser refers to technical images as those produced by an “apparatus,” or machine. However, the most important
				differentiation between the technical image and the so-called “traditional” one, lies not in the source of the image but in
				its reading. The technical image also contains magic, but because it is produced by an apparatus, an automatic piece of
				technology, it retains an appearance of being factual, representative of scientific accuracy and reality. Therefore the kind
				of magic a technical image contains is different and potentially dangerous:
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				Technical images are difficult to decode, for a strange reason. <span class="highlight">To all appearances, they do not have
				to be decoded since their significance is automatically reflected on their surface</span> &mdash; just like fingerprints,
				where the significance (the finger) is the cause and the image (the copy) is the consequence. (14)
			</p>

			<p>
				Extending the camera as an example, even today these apparatuses are coveted for their ability to capture a scene in the moment,
				and with complete accuracy. But at the most basic, chemical level, we already know that is not true: depending on the film, the
				lens, the developing process and so on, the color and lighting of the photograph can change drastically. And depending on a
				particular photograph’s subject matter, these variations can alter its reading. The misunderstandings continue as the photograph
				is used to designate a certain point in a historical timeline and people forget about the magic of the image.
			</p>

			<p>
				In January 2014, a <i>New Zealand Herald</i> article (later found to be derived from a
				<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2540955/Beijing-clouded-smog-way-sunrise-watch-giant-commercial-screens-Tiananmen-Square.html" target="_blank">
					<i>Daily Mail</i> article</a>) posted an image of a giant
				LED screen located in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, showing an image of a sunrise. The image, the article’s headline
				(“China starts televising sunrise due to smog”) and the accompanying text was posted on Tumblr by the user sandandglass:
			</p>

				<a href="imgs/chinaarticle2.png"><img src="imgs/chinaarticle1.png" /></a> <br/><br/>
				<a href="imgs/chinaarticle2.png"><img src="imgs/chinaarticle2.png" /></a><br/><br/>


			<p>
				Almost immediately the post went viral, receiving hundreds of thousands of reblogs and likes, with comments expressing
				shock, disbelief, or other statements about the environment. In his alarm, user bogleech commented, “How is this real and not
				a joke from a satirical science fiction novel about a dystopian polluted future.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Bogleech’s disbelief proved to be true. Eventually the post was responded to by the Tumblr user ximen, responded to the post,
				railing at length against the article, <a href="http://ximen.tumblr.com/post/73792207593/wolvensnothere-patchworksparrow-bogleech" target="_blank">
				stating that its portrayal of Beijing’s smog problem and the purpose of the LED screen itself were false.</a> As a resident of
				Beijing, she describes a scene, conveying the placement of the photograph within its location, in order to convince others of
				the article’s inaccuracies:
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				...Chinese people were not crowding into Tiananmen Square to watch the sun rise on a screen. See how few people there are in
				that picture? I walk by Tiananmen every weekday morning to get to work, and there are NEVER that few people out there. This is
				China! There are a lot of people here! Even in the pouring rain, there are more people in Tiananmen. Which makes sense! It was
				6:30 in the morning and the pollution was terrible. People were probably eat breakfast, getting dressed, making lunch, heading
				out to work. It’s not like there’s a ton of Beijingers who make a point of watching the sun rise every morning. Anyway, where
				would you go to watch the sun rise? There’s tall buildings everywhere! Moreover, most of the people in Tiananmen on any given
				day aren’t even Beijingers. They’re tourists, or people selling noisy light-up tops and Chinese flags and manchu empress
				headbands to the tourists. Your average Beijinger isn’t going to go into Tiananmen because they would have to stand in line,
				get their bag scanned, get wanded with a metal detector, and then shove their way through a crowded square. If you want to
				cross Tiananmen, you generally go around.
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				So what we have in this picture is a tiny handful of early morning tourists and vendors in an unusually deserted Tiananmen
				Square, and most of them are ignoring the bright screen that is showing the sun rise. That doesn’t really fit the narrative,
				does it?
			</p>

			<p>
				Here we have an example of the magic of an image revealed and for what purpose, at least as interpreted by ximen. Westerners,
				ximen argues, are always looking for any opportunity to validate the image of a communist dystopia run to ruin by its
				government’s disrespect for its people and environment. This photograph was an opportunity for an image of China to be projected
				and assumed as a representation of China.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, in this contemporary example we have more considerations to take into account in addition to those of the
				photograph as technical image and the camera as apparatus. The video of the sunrise on the LED screen is also a technical
				image. Though we cannot tell from the photograph, it could be largely a result of some sort of animation program . Ximen
				posted that photograph on her Tumblr, but if we read through it we also find an “image” of ximen as a Beijing resident and as
				someone who highly appreciates Chinese culture in general. For all we know, ximen has her own biases.
			</p>

			<p>
				To fit our contemporary purposes, the definition of the image needs to be updated to include all superficial,
				two-dimensional representations that includes other media: video, animation, charts and graphs, photo compositions, images
				recorded by machines free of human intent, websites, and entire social networks including the representations of the individuals
				of which they are comprised. These representations all have the same inherent issues as the still photograph.
			</p>

			<p>
				As the majority of images we see from day to day are considered technical, a redefinition of the image automatically calls for
				a redefinition of the apparatus.
			</p>

			<div id="05" class="title">The Apparatus</div>

			<p>
				The basis of distinguishing a technical image from a traditional one, is that technical images are, as mentioned before,
				produced by apparatuses. However, it is important to note that there is a distinct difference between apparatus and machine:
			</p>
			<p class="quote">
				Tools and machines work by tearing objects from the natural world and informing them, i.e. changing the world. But apparatuses
				do not work in that sense. <span class="highlight">Their intention is not to change the world but to change the meaning of the world.
				Their intention is symbolic.</span> (25)
			</p>

			<p>
				This implication also gives a new role to the “photographer,” or the person behind the apparatus:
			</p>
			<p class="quote">
				If they look through the camera out into the world, this is not because the world interests them but because they are pursuing
				new possibilities of producing information and evaluating the photographic program. Their interest is concentrated on the camera;
				for them, the world is purely a pretext for the realization of camera possibilities. In short: They are not working, they do not
				want to change the world, but they are in search of information. (26-27)
			</p>

			<p>
				The person behind the apparatus then is essentially a person at play.<sup>3</sup> It is not his or her role to act on the world,
				but to merely find the information contained in it and symbolically portray it to change the world’s meaning. For Flusser, the
				danger of the technical image lies not in the magic produced by its human producer, but in the programmed magic inherent in the
				apparatus that creates it. He describes the apparatus as a “black box” that produces the possibilities, and the photographer as
				the human element that chooses which of them to capture. Though there are many possibilities, they are all still those within
				the apparatus’ capabilities. By limiting the outcomes, there is a large danger that the technical image’s perception becomes our
				only view of what the world is like.
			</p>

			<div class="right">
				<span id="footnote">
					3 In this case I use “play” in the context of Flusser’s definition as the opposite of “work,” and its relation to generating
					“unpredictable and improbable” information (<i>Into the Universe of Technical Images</i>, 87).
				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				If we update the technical image to include all sorts of media however, we then have to update the definition of apparatus to
				the variety of programs that create said media. We are no longer photographers that only play with the camera, but a whole mass
				of producers who use cameras, video cameras, image editing software, animation programs, HTML, and so on. Not only have the
				apparatuses grown in number, but so have the producers. Flusser’s apparatus was a black box where mysterious chemical reactions
				unknown to the viewer and producer created the image. Now the creation of the new technical image is not necessarily so opaque.
				Personal computers and the software available for them have become so widespread, that viewing any image in print or the Internet
				is paired with the assumption that somehow, somewhere it has probably been edited.

				In December 2013, the Hungarian musician Boggie released the music video for her song “PÄRFUM.” In it, the musician sits in
				front of a grey background, facing towards the camera as an animated image-editing interface continues to adjust the lighting,
				background, and her appearance for the length of the video. In February 2014, it went viral on English news and entertainment
				blogs, who touted it for its criticism of pop industries’ methods of falsifying their stars’ appearances:
				<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/22/boggie-nouveau-parfum-photoshop-music-video_n_4645297.html" target="_blank">“Incredible Music

			</div>

			<p>
				As the video gained popularity, outlets seemed to expect the same reaction as the one that greeted the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpaOjMXyJGk" target="_blank">
				Dove Real Beauty campaign</a> which aired in April, 2013. Many of the comments on each of these outlets expressed similar
				sentiments of the need to celebrate natural beauty and to quit creating unreachable standards via technology. What ended up
				making this example different, however, were comments like this:
			</p>

			<img src="imgs/boggie1.png" />

			<p>
				To the unknowing eye (even the semi-knowing eye), the animations in the video are convincing: but in actuality the process shown
				in the video is only a symbolic representation of what video editing can do. For viewers like Sandreta97 the image represents a
				tool that exists in the world that she could possibly use. For others like Mike Spinak who know better, this is not so:
			</p>

			<a href="imgs/boggie2.png"><img src="imgs/boggie2.png" /></a>

			<p>
				Mike Spinak’s comment is his attempt to reveal the illusion, that technology is not capable of this type of magic, and that
				even video editing is still reliant on the human hand. His reading of the video is that its attempt to reveal a “truth” loses
				its persuasiveness because of its reliance on another un-truth. Other commenters disagree with him, arguing that he has focused
				too much on the technology and not on the message:
			</p>

			<a href="imgs/boggie4.png"><img src="imgs/boggie4.png" /></a><br/><br/>
			<a href="imgs/boggie5.png"><img src="imgs/boggie5.png" /> </a>

			<p>
				Some commenters deny that any viewer could interpret the video as real:
			</p>

			<a href="imgs/boggie6.png"><img src="imgs/boggie6.png" /></a>

			<p>
				Similar threads regarding the truth of the “technology” and the video’s concept occur on several different outlets. What
				these comments show is that as the software involved become more and more well known and their effects recognizable, the
				conversations surrounding these images can be focused on evaluating magic instead of the image’s surface. While commenters
				like Sandreta97 make it apparent that the technical image is still masking the world to some, Mike Spinak is an example of
				our increasingly technical vision: the ability to see through the superficial layer to decipher the apparatus. Soon the primary
				challenge will be to interpret who or what is behind the magic that lies beneath, rather than the image itself.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this case, we only know that Boggie is a Hungarian singer. We, as an American audience, do not know much about her. What
				would the comments be if she were known for having plastic surgery, or if she were just a bit uglier? The true power in an
				image on the Internet now comes from its audience’s bases of contextual knowledge. What Mike Spinak argues is the downfall of
				this particular video, is that the falsities that exist in the video will reverse the concept for some of the audience who do
				not know better. He would most likely be satisfied if the actual, painstaking process were made clear.
			</p>

			<p>
				In other cases we can imagine that the real process is intentionally hidden. As I will argue in the following sections, the
				now almost universal availability of various apparatuses has actually made the programmed magic of technical images more
				transparent (though there are still certain apparatuses that elude understanding by the masses and are therefore still
				problematic). The real concern now, with ubiquitous use of the Internet, is that magic, the magic of the apparatuses themselves,
				can become opaque and used as tools of manipulation and control. It is the context of the apparatus that needs to be evaluated.
				As long as there is that recognition, the context, real or not, becomes integral to the perception of the image and the meaning
				of the world that it projects. As Don Kerley puts it:
			</p>

			<img src="imgs/boggie3a.png" />

			<div id="06" class="title">The complications of magic: the infographic</div>

			<p>
				In the Boggie example we see a music video with a message being misinterpreted and reinterpreted based on its use and display
				of a technology. It illustrates that while the issue of the technical image according to Flusser still exists, many people
				have been able to peel the superficial layer away to examine the magic of the apparatus, as evinced in the comments section.
				In this case, Boggie and her video director’s intentions are well meaning and the basic interpretation is clear even if there
				are some critics. In other cases, the intentions are less innocent and more effectively masked, producing the effect of the
				technical image’s first-order magic.
			</p>

			<p>
				Around 2011, “infographics,” a collection of charts compiled into a larger package and cohesive to one particular point or
				theme, became a huge fad. Cleverly designed infographics evolved into fully designed narratives that sometimes act as blog posts
				and articles in themselves. Subject matter and form ranges from a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/an-original-duckumentary/infographic- all-about-ducks/8040/" target="_blank">
				straightforward collection of facts about ducks</a>, to <a href="http://kaplaninternational.com/blog/learning-languages/" target="_blank">a
				collection of data that proves a particular point such as the benefits of learning languages</a>. These infographics are
				difficult to categorize as images because although their web presence, vector aesthetics, and factual content make them appear
				completely technical, all of the designing, narrative building, and curation of information is executed a way that correlates
				more with the traditional image. The most impressive infographics use custom color schemes and incorporate an illustrative
				quality to their charts, requiring the designer to draw them rather than have a machine automatically create them.
			</p>
			<p>
				This blurring is probably why these infographics became so popular. Eventually various startup companies<sup>4</sup> appeared,
				promising instant, easy infographic creation for everyone, pitching memberships for communities of creative data visualization
				creators, with the end goal of creating a database of sellable content. While most of the information is available freely,
				turning that information into an engaging object to look at became a source of profit (“the world’s marketplace for visual
				content” boasts visual.ly’s tagline), even if its factual contents are not properly cited or represented. In essence, these
				websites have created an apparatus specifically for infographics.

				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				The magic here points to the infographic as a technical image. Despite the artistry involved in its creation, in the end
				the infographic reads as an accurate representation of the world. This misreading happens because its aesthetic is read as
				machine-created and therefore reproducible by machine, as shown by the variety of websites that allow you to make them easily
				by yourself. Because software and these various online tools let anyone, with or without experience in statistics or
				experimental design, produce them, there is an extremely high chance of inaccuracy or misrepresented information. The magic is
				best revealed when a bad graphic reveals the nature of its creation through its illegibility. In capable hands, however, data
				can be converted to powerful marketing tools or deceptive displays of pseudo-science.

				In this example from <i>the Wall Street Journal</i>, the bar graph on the left is the original image accompanying an article
				about wealth distribution in the United States. At a glance, the skew of the chart makes it look like the middle class earns
				the most collective income. However, upon closer inspection, as Jon Chait noticed, the range of income brackets that make up the
				x-axis are not evenly distributed. As Chait illustrates in the adjusted bar graph on the right, if you were to equally distribute
				income as you should, then the graph looks much different and displays a much different conclusion: whereas the original chart
				seems to represent a balanced national economic distribution, the accurately portrayed chart makes the skew in favor of the top

			<p>
				Scaling issues are quite common and are, technically, a factually correct way to skew information. And while most offenses
				are not as blatant or purposeful as the one above, infographics have gained increasing criticism for misrepresenting information
				through visually appealing but conceptually useless graphics and narratives that overemphasize certain facts while reducing the
				apparent importance of others. Like Boggie’s video, most of the criticism comes from professionals like statisticians and
				graphic designers who understand the mechanics of these sorts of communications. Some, like the members of graphic design
				firm <a href="http://zabisco.com" target="_blank">Zabisco</a>, have appropriated the aesthetic of the common infographic to
				illustrate their criticism.
			</p>

			<p>
				In some cases obvious inaccuracies become tools of satire. The pie chart meme allows anyone with graphing software to create a
				humorous statement about any subject they want. Topics range from pop culture commentary (“Why I like reading about Justin Bieber
				in the news”), societal tendencies (“what men like about women”), and breakdowns of Internet behavior (“Any Tumblr-wide
				Controversy”). The meme is a key example of how an image’s accessibility via the web can act both as a tool for, and as indicator
				of an individual’s and a culture’s understanding of a topic.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here I’ve presented infographics as a newer and particularly problematic example of a technical image: the types of images
				we are exposed to are not limited to any one type of magic. We also see in the Zabisco example that already there are people
				who read through that magic, at a depth that allows them to make a convincing parody of their own. This type of subversion,
				which flips around the image’s programmed magic, has become increasingly common as imaging softwares become more ubiquitous
				and as the Internet encourages their dissemination. My opinion is that these subversions, as part of our piecing together a
				universe based on technical images, show signs of a developing worldview that incorporates context and scene into interpretation,
				and embraces two-dimensional magic as a new living space.

			<p>
				In the first section of this book, I presented definitions of the technical image and apparatus with consideration to
				their placement on the Internet. I showed through various examples their impacts on our perceptions and how our cohabitation
				with them has allowed us to begin seeing through the surface and interpret them from a deeper level. I believe that perceptibly
				authoritative media, whether journalistic (the Beijing sunrise), commercial (the Hungarian music video), or in between
				(infographics), are now positioned so that the public is either already aware or can be notified when untruth or inaccuracy is
				suspected.<sup>5</sup>
			</p>


			<p>
				I have reiterated thus far that online life and physical life both have very real effects, and that they are not at all
				separate but converge into one person’s worldview. I do not mean that there is a literal equality between physical and
				virtual,<sup>6</sup> that one can potentially replace the other, but that in terms of aggregate experience, the life lived
				in one has the same weight of influence as the other. But I argue that ultimately all of our actions performed in one space
				stems from the same desires and needs that are promoted in the other. Now that we have built a new space from the aspirations
				of the older one, it makes sense that the old world starts to reflect the desires of the new one.

			<div class="right">
				<span id="footnote">
					5 The technical image was never the cause of journalistic disintegrity anyway, so at least there is now a more public

				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				Still, most are probably apprehensive to say that what they see online can be considered a part of “reality.” There is a
				lingering issue regarding the seemingly inherent value of tangible materials and physical ownership that are currently missing
				from definitions of the virtual. It is obvious that what we do online must be different in nature than what we do physically.
				And it is because these spaces are so inherently distinct that our judgments clash when a new space becomes so ubiquitous that
				it meets the other, longer established one. In no other topic is this clash so apparent than in social issues: Perhaps the two
				spaces have equal psychological effects, but because the physical is so present, so immediate, does it not have a natural
				precedence in importance, or in value? Isn’t the experience of something in the flesh and blood truer, more authentic than
				its digital representation? How can the profile picture ever compare to the actual person?

			<p>
				In many ways, this conversation is analogous to the debates surrounding the value of photography as art: How can photography
				convey the same expressive value when it is the machine that does the capturing (a problem of originality)? What is the material
				value of something infinitely reproducible (a problem of “aura”)? With the digital social, value judgments are placed on a
				person who is mediating his or her persona through digital representation. And because we understand that these images are
				not necessarily representative of truth, what comes into contention now is not the images, as in the earlier case of photography,
				but their poster.
			</p>
			<p>
				And so begins the criticism of social media obsession and Internet narcissism: the constant tweeting of the mundane,
				the selfies that all look alike, the food photos, the constant calls for attention via likes and comments. Emotions become
				shallow, and we become alienated through the facade of connection: the Internet is made for you to feel safe within a mass,
				not to actually be yourself. Online you often find articles spouting its detriments in the very medium for which they are
				distributed: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/ailsa-cameron-when-teen- agers-lose-touch-with-reality-773071.html" target="_blank">
				high school girl Alisa Cameron writes for <i>The Independent</i></a>, “[The Internet is] so instant and accessible, but it’s
				easy to forget that these are virtual sites. You do not actually belong to anything; you are merely one of millions of internet
				users. It’s a distorted reality that’s easy to get sucked into; a few tapped keys and decisions are made.” Cameron writes about
				her peers faced with depression, trapped in social media where their individual cries for help are dispersed among those of
				“attention-seekers,” a criticism of the Internet’s apparent inability to maintain any authenticity.
			</p>


			<p>
				“Stay positive, go for a walk, make face-to-face eye contact” a New England real estate agent known as “W”
				repeats to multiple
				accounts of Twitter loneliness. W was one respondent of the collaborative project <a href="http://moriandyama.com/portfolio/postcards.html" target="_blank"><i>Can someone talk with me?</i></a> I conducted in 2013.
				In this project, several strangers were handed postcards decorated with expressions of loneliness drawn from Twitter. W
				insisted she take one of each to distribute among her coworkers, but to my and my collaborators’ surprise she had responded
				to all of them. As two-dimensional as she seems to believe these online expressions are, her responses to them are even more so:
				the apparent sincerity yet amazing banality of her language paired against the varying degrees of seriousness and visual content
				of the postcards reveals her fascinating unawareness of the contextual shifts that happen in online expressiveness, such as the
				nuances of “loneliness” that can be expressed as both a knowingly futile call for attention or the setup for a joke. Similarly,
				though Cameron points towards social media as a problem for recognizing depression, her concerns really stem from a problem in
				 recognizing contextual nuances.
			</p>

			<p>
				While W’s responses were indeed an anomaly within the entire collection of <i>Can someone talk with me?</i>, her attitude is not
				far off from many who plug unplugging as the path to true life experiences. As social media is one of the primary sites of
				online use, it is no surprise that the nature of relationships on such platforms are the main site of criticism, based on
				the perception that they are a risk-free and source of avoidance. “You won’t find true friends on the internet,” W writes.
				“Don’t think what you find on the internet will ever replace human contact.” “You need to give away what you want to
				receive.” These judgments are in part a result of the knowledge everyone has regarding how social media content is produced
				and the time and variable depth of expressions recorded. They are quick, easy snapshots taken on phones and web cameras
				in seconds.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, the digital image (including a tweet or status update) is not a singular object of representation, something
				that these postcards admittedly misrepresent. To view it is a completely separate situation than when it is created, a fact
				that is known by both poster and viewer. The digital image is only perceptible when it is involved in an event: the act of
				loading and viewing which happens at a specific time in a specific space.
			</p>

			<p>
				These events are not necessarily any different from the social events that happen in physical life. All social interactions,
				whether virtual or physical, share certain similarities. Mainly, online social interactions follow the same desires as those
				in physical ones but are performed in different spaces and therefore take on different forms. And while certain tensions and
				uncertainties are mitigated online, the same anxieties regarding the appearance of the self within the larger group present
				in physical situations do not disappear. Just like these anxieties and desires are often exploited for the purpose of
				commodification and profit, the same is done online but with the added quantifiable power of the apparatus.
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal for the following section is to expand on previous explanations of the technical image and its apparatus in terms of
				social interactions through online platforms. To reiterate, the technical image of today is an image that holds multiple layers
				of readings, to which I have referred earlier as magic. These layers can be either a result of the creator’s intent or of the
				programmed power of the production-apparatus. They are of varying mediums and can be layered into larger, more complexly
				composed images such as a blog or website. These larger images are also produced by apparatuses that are primarily used to
				organize and display. In the social scenario these are social media platforms that form the interface for giant databases of
				social networks. By investigating specific cases of these new images and apparatuses, we find that not only is the sociality
				of them genuine &mdash; or at least as genuine as those in physical spaces &mdash; but that their new forms result in the creation of
				communities and cultural values<sup>7</sup>.

			<p>
				Because online spaces are so vast and activities and populations so diverse, the majority of my arguments are within
				the online spaces that I find most influential for identity and community formation through the sharing of content. While
				the issues of the spectacle involved with the technical image and its apparatus are still present and perhaps amplified with

				to generate new meanings and forge cultural significance in new spaces. Here I will discuss the use of images for the
				communication of identity and personality, including such cases where leisurely use reveals these in unintended ways.
			</p>

			<p>
				I feel that it is important to reiterate the influence of the technical image on our perceptions and how we interpret
				meaning. Unlike the traditional image, the technical image is not just a mirror of the world, but a projection<sup>8</sup>.
				In terms of identity and the presentation of oneself in social settings, online the image is not only a process of building
				and presenting, but also of expectation, reflection, and reinterpretation. There is great weight in how images are spread,
				shared, used, and remembered.

			<div class="right">
				<span id="footnote">
					8 Flusser, <i>Into the Universe of Technical Images</i> (48).
				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				Upon reevaluating the magic of the technical image, we have a whole new understanding of the term “photographic memory.”
				Time and time again, records from courtroom eyewitness accounts and laboratory experiments show that in most cases our memory
				is highly unreliable. In <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/05/ads-implant-false-memories/" target="_blank">an experiment
				reported on <i>wired.com</i> entitled “Ads Implant False Memories,”</a> 100 people were shown
				either a text-based “low imagery” advertisement, or a “high imagery” video advertisement for the same fictional popcorn product.
				In each case, a control group was given an unrelated survey afterwards, while another group was given a sample of popcorn
				representing the fictional product. One week later the 100 were asked to report about the experiment.
			</p>

			<p>
				The result: whereas the groups that experienced the text advertisement were unlikely to report trying the popcorn at all,
				members of the group who had seen the “high imagery” ad but had not sampled the snack were statistically as
				likely to report that they had tried it as the group that had actually tried it. Not only did they obtain a false
				memory, but were so confident in this memory that they even rated the snack as highly as subjects who had actually tried it.
			</p>

			<p>The article cites “memory reconsolidation” as the cause: </p>

			<p class="quote">
				<span class="highlight">The recall is altered in the absence of the original stimulus, becoming less about what we actually remember and more
				about what we’d like to remember.</span> It’s the difference between a “Save” and the “Save As” function. Our memories are a
				“Save As”: They are files that get rewritten every time we remember them, which is why the more we remember something, the
				less accurate the memory becomes.
			</p>

			<p>
				The analogy of “Save” and “Save As” is particularly relevant. Typically in cognitive science, comparing one’s brain and
				memories to computer memory is considered completely unfounded: the visual memory cannot be saved pixel for pixel as it
				is on a computer. The frame of our vision is more like a spotlight that is focused on whatever is relevant to us at the time.
				As the case study proves, people are too easily influenced by outside stimuli. It is a fairly common case in eyewitness
				testimony where what is considered relevant suddenly changes and must be recalled: even a spoken suggestion can completely
				convince a witness of an unintended falsified truth because the memory tries to make up for that context. The suggestion can
				be as subtle as “What did you see at the crash site?” versus “Did you witness a crash at the site?”
			</p>

			<p>
				However, the analogy changes when the file is a digital file that is spread through various websites on the Internet. It is
				always a “Save As” action. Like a memory, the Internet image is forged from the basis of a real event, but is never actually
				an original in its own right. The data communicated become a perceptive event that is factored into a whole network of
				accompanying knowledge. Internet images, in their vast quantity and mobility, are weak. They depend on the space in which
				they are presented: If you recall the popcorn in the context of seeing someone enjoy it you may remember that you enjoyed
				it as well. Or if someone suggests that you saw a broken car at a scene where there was none, you might remember that you
				witnessed a crash more violent than it actually was. Likewise, the digital image is always surrounded by other information
				that affects its reading. And, like a memory, it can be retold to a different audience with different points emphasized.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because the digital image is always a form of “high imagery,” containing a high level of evocative power, the circumstances in
				which it is presented become, as we see in the courtroom example, crucial to its recall and interpretation.
				The weaker images become, the more we depend on their increasingly complex and convoluted environments. This is why context
				becomes so important: ignorance of the situation surrounding the presentation of some information can lead to a misunderstanding
				of its intentions (or lack thereof). With the exception of the laboratory &mdash; and even then it is difficult to control &mdash;
				information is never consumed in a context-free environment. This weakness allows people to create new contexts and spaces for
				others, as well as layer their own aspirational projections.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is this weakness that allows for popularized instances of “catfishing” and false identities, but also of persona creation
				that is not so much false as it is just not physically realized. It is also important to emphasize here that online social
				interactions, while rooted in the same sorts of desires and needs that have always existed, take shape in a certain way because
				of the apparatuses through which they are expressed. The context of these apparatuses, how they are intended to be used and by
				what audience, becomes the space for certain social activities that share the same fragmented characteristics of offline
				activity: what one community collectively knows is different than what another does. Like any other environment, we learn to
				read and adapt to it behaviorally in order to obtain what we need from it.

				In the same way that a ballet happens at a set time and location, the digital file does not exist in one form physically but
				performs within the environment in which it is set to display. The file is not the dancer, who exists as a singular entity,
				but her choreography, which can be imitated and performed again by many dancers in different spaces and times. This choreography
				can also be incorporated into several distinct compositions, among other dancers each with her own choreography. While the digital
				file can be viewed unaccompanied, its weakness allows it to only disclose real meaning when it is integrated within a bigger
				production.

				Online, these performances are always occurring within a gigantic mass of others. In contemporary web spaces, most of the
				information we view from day to day is not separated into distinct topics, but consolidated into networks where all pieces
				of content are equalized and placed side by side. The heyday for content-specific fan pages, image galleries, and personal
				homepages is no more. There is no prima ballerina but a giant group of dancers where a picture of your friend’s dinner is on
				the same stage as the State of the Union address and advertisements for mobile applications. In this mass of free and open
				information, the primary goal for web services and users is to select and curate the visibility of certain types of performances
				and their settings. This is in itself a performance by the user. When I use the term “performance,” I employ it in its definition
				as set by Boris Groys in his discussions of the visual arts that now live largely through digitalization. Digitalization in the
				art space produces questions about originality and aura, the role of artist, and of artistic authorities. I find this confusion
				of roles and the questions about authenticity similar to what we now examine about online sociality. In the confusing mass of
				consolidated information, how can we possibly use it to express ourselves in any sort of genuine manner?
			</p>

			<p>
				In Groys’ words, the answer is in curation:
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				Digitalization, that is, the writing of the image, helps the image become reproducible, to circulate freely, to distribute itself.
				It is therefore the medicine that cures the image of its inherent passivity. <span class="highlight">But at the same time, the digitalized image becomes
				even more infected with non-identity — with the necessity of presenting the image as dissimilar to itself, which means that
				supplementary curing of the image — its curating becomes unavoidable</span> (87).
			</p>

			<p>
				Essentially all websites are spaces of curation in terms of presenting certain types of information for specific audiences.
				For commercial websites this is obvious, as they are used as marketing tools that are created for communicating a singular message.
				The classic image of the Angelfire or Geocities homepage also comes to mind: before Google Images was available, galleries of images
				pertaining to a certain topic were collected and visited by fans who might pick their favorites and display them in turn on their
				own page. Similarly, the old “about me” page would be designed around displaying a certain set of facts for the expected online
				public. Contemporary social media platforms are also spaces of curation, allowing you to selectively post content that corresponds
				to the identity of that particular profile, depending on who you expect to view it. But as Groys argues, it is not enough for that
				image to just be placed somewhere: it must be performed, backed up by a constant stream of updates that reinforce and extend the
				image set by the profile.
			</p>

			<div class="right">
				<img src="imgs/facebookopt.png" /> <br/>
				<span class="caption">Facebook timeline sort options</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				Curation is not only the act of the individual however, but also of the platform’s design in the visual and technical sense, as
				well as in the branding sense. Facebook is branded based on the promise of connecting you to others from your offline spaces, and
				appears to chronologically organize the content posted by your family, friends, and acquaintances. Algorithmically however, there
				is additional filtering that prioritizes posts that receive more likes and comments, which Facebook calls “Top Stories.” Unless
				the user changes this default setting, the hierarchy of posts in his or her timeline is based more on activity rather than time.
				Twitter’s timeline does prioritize time, displaying all tweets from all of the accounts the user chooses to follow in reverse
				chronological order. On Twitter the user’s curatorial power is self-directed, selecting which streams of time are displayed but
				with no control over the context in which his own tweets may be placed. Tumblr’s dashboard feed is similar, the difference being
				that Tumblr provides two contexts for user content: one in the continuous feed of the dashboard among followed blogs, and one that
				is self-contained as its own webpage that can be removed from Tumblr’s platform and attached to a custom URL instead.
			</p>

			<p>
				These subtle differences in the design of the user experience are part of the mechanisms of the apparatus, creating what Flusser
				describes as programmed magic:
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				It looks here as if photographers could choose freely, as if their cameras were following intention. But the choice is limited
				to the categories of the camera, and <span class="highlight">the freedom of the photographer remains a programmed freedom.</span> Whereas the apparatus functions
				as a function of the photographer’s intention, this intention itself functions as a function of the camera’s program. It goes without
				saying that photographers can discover new categories<sup>9</sup>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the visual sense this programmed magic is visible in the way that images are edited using production-apparatuses: how colors
				are adjusted, body parts smoothed and reshaped. But it is also applicable to how the social media apparatus allows you to express
				something. While there appears to be a larger freedom in physical spaces to make yourself heard in the way you want to whomever
				you want, the controls and restraints of Facebook and other platforms are not so unlike those that are present in our face-to-face
				interactions. While there is a perception of a “true” self (apparent in the linguistics of singularly defining “who am I” or stating
				“you are not being yourself”), we are in actuality constantly adjusting our behaviors to suit different categories of social events.
				You have business relationships with people who understand certain topics differently than your familial relationships or friendships.
				While sites like LinkedIn make these distinctions clear, other sites like Facebook encourage the production of a “true” self that must
				span many categories of physical relationships. Yet having one performance for those different audiences is something largely
				impossible to deal with offline. Facebook as apparatus, with its mass quantity of users and databases of past interactions makes it
				seem as if we should be able to track and understand all of these connections, coercing us into forgetting that our interactions are
				based not on objective facts and truth, but on certain “fictions”<sup>10</sup> that we collectively agree upon. That is, we do not typically
				feel that we must reveal all of our relationships or feelings to everyone, that some belong to certain spaces where others do not,
				and that there are multiple versions of our “true” selves that are specific to those spaces and relationships.

				The seeming ubiquity of Facebook is in itself an anomaly, as described by danah boyd: “The idea of everybody going to one site is

				space and time has allowed the fragmentation of social spaces to occur almost infinitesimally, to the most specific of interests,
				as long as they can still maintain communities with enough active members. Before where communities were always in part bound by
				location, new niche communities can now arise unbound by physical locale and their implied cultural boundaries. Within these new
				groups of people bound by certain similarities, new cultural understandings are communicated via the only way they can be online:

				Poor images are thus popular images – images that can be made and seen by the many. They express all the contradictions of the

				The Internet has an inherent context problem. It is a common experience to chat with a person online and be confronted with a
				reply that is confusing because its textual legibility does not match its expressive legibility. However, as online communities
				become more populated, some expressions become generally accepted and collectively defined as having a specific meaning,
				essentially creating a language that is used between members that share the knowledge of how to read it. Some of this language
				is relatively universal, while some remains more specific to certain spaces. These expressions are like dialects or colloquialisms
				that originate in certain places, but may also spread to others in acts of cultural exchange.
			</p>

			<p>

The meme is a category of online content that is loaded with cultural meaning. Typically originating with an image or video,
				often, but not necessarily, text is overlaid with a new message to make a humorous comment. The meme
				is not a single item, but a movement of activity that follows the original post or inspiration, based around the context of its
				origin but not necessarily relating to it.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2013 a meme known as “doge” became extremely popular. In its most familiar form, doge consists of a picture of a seated shiba
				inu captioned with pastel, Comic Sans phrases spread around the dog’s face. The text’s grammar structure and spelling mistakes
				follow a very specific tone and style. According to its entry on <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge" target="_blank">
					knowyourmeme.com</a>, this image was originally disseminated on Tumblr before becoming popular elsewhere.
			</p>

				<span class="caption">The iconic “doge” meme in two iterations</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				The origins of the doge image and misspelled name come from different sources that in no way inform the result. The first
				misspelling and pronunciation of “dog” originates from a webisode of Homestar Runner<sup>11</sup>, which was published in 2005, a whole
				eight years prior to the meme. Similarly, the identification of the shiba inu in the picture has no relation to its likeness
				being used for humorous effect. In fact, after its spread, it is generally accepted that all pictures of shiba inus can be
				referred to as doges, and paired with the same style of monologue. Unlike other memes such as the “ridiculously photogenic guy”<sup>12</sup>,
				which rely on a singular image to represent multiple meanings, doge manages to exist and maintain popularity through the
				collective understanding of a particular aesthetic and humor that was created based off a certain image, but no longer dependent
				on it. Additionally, much like the previously widespread “LOLcat” meme, the grammar of doge is often used even without the
				presence of the picture, reflecting a certain attitude about a topic of interest.

				Some expressions are very specific to certain platforms and populations, such as the phrases explained in the glossary of
				<a href="http://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/anonymity_as_culture__treatise" target="_blank">David
				Auerbach’s “Anonymity as Culture: Case Studies.”</a> In his treatise, Auerbach references what he calls “A-culture,” an online community
				which bases its existence largely on the embraced anonymity of its members. A-culture is most famously associated with the website
				4chan and trolls-turned-activist group Anonymous, and is notorious for spawning a particular attitude and language that reflects
				it. One example Auerbach defines is “mfw”:
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				“mfw” (my face when) is an example of identity slippage. The phrase is often used with an image of someone exhibiting a reaction,
				as a response to a prior comment; the expression depicted merges with that of the person who posts it. Most images are posted to
				imageboards as content unto themselves, but here they serve an emotive purpose: They temporarily efface the anonymity of the poster,
				usually by appropriating some bit of common cultural knowledge (e.g., images of characters from The Simpsons, anime, A-culture itself,
				etc.).
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				“mfw” may also be used without any image whatsoever, as in “mfw reading this post.” In this case readers are asked, and assumed
				to be able, to imagine the poster’s expression &mdash; usually some form of disgust, condescending amusement, or ridicule &mdash; without any visual
				reference. Such is the inferential nature of the A-culture hive mind.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here the image is brought out of its original context and used as a tool of expression. The phrase mfw is simply a cue that an
				image will perform in order to convey a particular emotion belonging to the poster. The origin of the image, what television show
				or character, does not actually matter so much as the facial expression shown. Despite that, the types of images used for mfw are
				as described, referential to common knowledge within the community. If used within a different community, the expression may be
				read in a slightly different manner. For example, while both 4chan and Tumblr have large communities of anime enthusiasts, 4chan’s
				threads favor series that inspire more sexual images, whereas a larger percentage of Tumblr’s community favors a cute or “kawaii”
				aesthetic. While to the non-expert the distinction may be minimal, to the members of either community the source may point to a
				subtle clue regarding the poster’s personality or the emotion he or she expresses.
			</p>

			<p>
				What is particularly interesting about mfw is that the actual use of the phrase, as Auerbach suggests, originally meant to
				accompany an illustrative image, has evolved to not need the image at all, as long as it makes sense in the context of a few
				particular emotions. These emotions of “disgust, condescending amusement, or ridicule” are common attitudes surrounding A-culture
				in general, where trolling and political incorrectness are defining characteristics. To use mfw without an image with another
				emotion outside of these categories would probably be unsuccessful or at least ambiguous. The formation of cultural understanding
				creates a particular ambience around the members of A-culture and the online spaces they inhabit: one that exists not in an object,
				but in contextual knowledge.
			</p>

			<div class="right">
				<img src="imgs/mfw.png" /><br/>
				<span class="caption">
Examples of “mfw” from Google Images, March 25, 2014</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				Much of A-culture lives on sites where images are not typically used for self-expression and instead text comments and responses
				are the primary interactions between members. Differences in how the image is used to express oneself are also directly related
				to the capabilities and designs of the various platforms that the images are posted on. In the case of 4chan, images are used as
				content, but not displayed in any sort of format that makes the full viewing experience easy. To view any of the images at full
				size requires a click-through, and animated gifs are not distinguished clearly from static images. So even though mfw and reaction
				gifs ultimately accomplish the same goal, on Tumblr gifs that show full actions are favored over static facial expressions because
				its platform has the capability to show them immediately.
			</p>

			<p>
				While A-culture discourages identification related to physical spaces, the most popular and commonly used platforms today
				(Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr) are directly associated with a specific persona that implies tangible associations with physical
				communities and spaces offline. As social networking becomes a seemingly required activity for many, we take advantage of these
				loose and fast virtual spaces to explore how we define ourselves and perform for others.
			</p>

			<div class="title">productive appropriation of the weak apparatus</div>

			<p>
				While mfw and memes are examples of weak images being appropriated to relay new meanings, the online apparatus, while much
				stronger in both infrastructure and identity, or branding, than the image, exhibits some weakness as well. These weaknesses can
				and are often used to accomplish certain forms of communication that users find more entertaining (and thus effective) than what
				is implied in the original design. Artists have a rich history in subverting the programmed uses of online spaces to say something
				different than those spaces originally intended to imply: <a href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org" target="_blank">jodi.org’s
					manipulation of “view source” versus the web browser</a>, Eva and
				Franco Mattes’ use of <a href="http://0100101110101101.org/no-fun/" target="_blank">chatroulette</a> and
				<a href="http://0100101110101101.org/reenactments/" target="_blank">Second Life</a> as sites for social experimentation, and Jon Rafman and Clement Valla’s
				transformations of Google’s algorithmic map images into photography (<a href="http://9-eyes.com" target="_blank"><i>9eyes</i></a>
				and <a href="http://www.postcards-from-google-earth.com" target="_blank"><i>Postcards from Google Earth</i></a>
				respectively) are just a few examples.
			</p>

			<p>
				This type of manipulation, however, is not an act limited to artists. Regular users are constantly creating small-scale
				subversions, bending the rules of code and apparatus for their own purposes. In some cases it is an additional extension of what
				the apparatus is meant to do. In the case of Twitter, it is not likely that its developers predicted its potentials for aiding
				political protests. In the everyday scenario, its linguistic features are constantly used in ways beyond those that cease to be
				useful for algorithms and instead form new models of language. The hashtag, originally intended to generate trackable metadata,
				can deliberately be used in the “wrong” way in order to signify something else than it seems to be achieving on its surface. So
				while certain hashtags like #Seattle have specific goals in terms of text-based search, location specification, etc., using
				hashtags where the apparent function disappears can insinuate something else. These actions, shown in the following examples,
				reveal an awareness of what the feature is supposed to be used for, and an understanding of what their misuse of it represents
				instead:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>my fuking <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cat&amp;src=hash">#cat</a>

			<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

			<p>
				In the first example, the tagging of ambiguous words not likely to be searched implies an acknowledgement of Twitter as a form
				of expression through the mildly sarcastic use of its most famous feature. Perhaps it is meant as an acknowledgement of the
				mundanity of the tweet’s content and how it fits into the general perception of how the site is used. The hashtags contribute to
				an attitude that reads something like “I realize that this fact is not likely to interest anyone but I will share it anyway knowing
				this.” The latter example has a more sincere tone, using longer phrases and essentially unsearchable hashtags as a representation of
				afterthoughts of the event written normally. The fragmented language of the hashtag allows the user to not only employ fewer
				characters, but to also assign a different tone to separate thoughts: written normally we understand the conflict with the insect
				as the event, while the hashtags provide the mental state of the poster as this event happened.
			</p>

			<P>
				In other cases beyond the Twitter hashtag, the subversion is more obvious. During the second presidential debate in 2012
				between President Barack Obama and then-Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, Romney responded to a question regarding gender
				pay inequality, saying that he requested “binders full of women” in the attempt to find
				more qualified women to hire. The
				phrase immediately went viral, becoming a trending tag on Twitter, and a source for parody after parody. Aside from the usual
				circulation on Twitter, Tumblr, and other social media sites, a remarkable example showed up on the web commerce site Amazon:
				on one product page for a typical three-ringed binder, people started writing reviews that were not about the actual product
				but of Romney’s comment.

			<p>
				The use of a usually straightforward and useful feature for satirical commentary makes it the more entertaining and
				successful. Upon seeing the first reviews, others quickly jumped in, making the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Avery-Durable-Binder-11-Inch-17032/product-reviews/B001B0CTMU/ref=dpx_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1" target="_blank">
					“Avery Durable View Binder with 2-Inch
				Slant Ring” product page</a> a unique space for communication, completely outside the expectations of Amazon. Since then the
				same methodology has been used with a few select other products such as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hutzler-571-Banana-Slicer/product-reviews/B0047E0EII/ref=dpx_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1" target="_blank">
					Hutzler Banana Slicer</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mountain-Three-Short-Sleeve/product-reviews/B002HJ377A/ref=dpx_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1" target="_blank">Three Wolf Moon
				T-Shirt</a>, and a package of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/BIC-Cristal-1-0mm-Black-MSLP16-Blk/product-reviews/B004F9QBE6/ref=dpx_acr_txt?showViewpoints=1" target="_blank">
					Bic Cristal “For Her” ball point pens</a>. What is remarkable in these examples is that while Amazon
				is a widely used site for a particular function that draws people to it regardless of personal interest or background,
				the participants of this action collectively understand the context and balance required to render it effective. Using this
				gesture too often on too many different products leaves irrelevant content for someone who actually wants to know
				whether or not to buy a product. However, these users have managed to pick and choose products that are effective because
				of their absurdity (in the case of the banana slicer and wolf t-shirt), or because of the potential commentary about a
				certain issue (gender issues in the case of the binder and the For Her pens). This act of consideration is vital for the
				action’s success, and very much related to place and time.

			<p>
				In short, users on various platforms are able to reclaim programmed spaces and appropriate them for new purposes. On the
				Internet, these purposes are often humor-driven, but as we see on Amazon this humor sometimes acts as a pointer towards
				larger issues. In the case of Twitter linguistics, it can also be a much more subtle action that leads to a transformation
				of how we use language. While there are arguments that shortened forms of communicating like Twitter and texting are “ruining”
				language, what these arguments point to is not a wrecking of some rigid object, but an observation of linguistic flux that is
				and has always occurred. Whether or not instances of this flux, such as the transformation of the subordinating conjunction
				“because” to a preposition<sup>13</sup>, persist or disappear in history, is up to its patterns of use through time.
			</p>

			<p>
				What we see happening to language in online spaces is happening to other aspects of our lives as well: shifts that have always
				been in motion but are sped up because of the increasing mobility of information, made more complex by our massive communities
				and fragmented spaces of interaction. And while the same philosophical and psychological concerns regarding humanity will most
				likely always remain, we see that through insight and mastery of the image and apparatus, productive appropriation and reclaiming
				of these online spaces can occur for the development of something else. At the same time, the ignorance or at least the
				unconscious acceptance of an infrastructure, physical or virtual, can lead to subliminal oppression by what Ippolita and
				Tiziana Mancinelli call “default power: the power to change the lives of millions of users by changing a few parameters”<sup>14</sup>:
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				Data are not simply collected, they are the result of multiple sociotechnical arrangements of technological and human actors

				continuing the development of new hybrid forms of autopoiesis, framing individuals within world managed by technocracies (161).
			</p>

			<p>
				Here the need for understanding the apparatus’ magic is crucial. Without doing so, we are vulnerable to the apparatus’ power
				to both use and mold us for its own purposes while enforcing these perceptions on the world. While our natural inclinations
				for social activity can allow us to be productive, the apparatus has the potential to force its parameters back on us and

			<p>
				So far in this section, I have described how online social interactions share similar functional characteristics as those
				offline, creating locations of communal significance that are in turn mediated by the spaces in which they exist. Social
				interactions in either space are fragmented, as well as fully dependent on the architectures and contexts in which they
				take place. As explained, these spaces are formed by the communities as well as the apparatuses (platforms) that support
				them, and the technical images with which they use to communicate. As these images are central to the type of language we
				use online, so is the interpretation of their magic. When we begin to understand the images produced, we then look for the
				person behind them. The apparatus and its structural prowess however, still tend to remain just out of our vision.
			</p>

			<p>
				As I have mentioned, the awareness and understanding of image production has allowed us to take advantage of certain spaces
				in ways not intended in their original design. In most cases, however, we are displaying information in ways that are
				supported and designated by the platforms. These infrastructural details can easily blend into the background, into nature,
				while we analyze the images. While we believe that the transparency of image creation allows us to see the individual behind
				them, what we are actually seeing is a different part of the apparatus. The anxiety over the authenticity and “realness” of
				our actions is a notion that is historically rooted and built into the platform, and not for a fear of strangers. It is a
				construct placed by profit-driven interests that have leaked into our perceptions of physical space, which causes someone
				like our friend W to tell people to go take a walk and make real friends. As Jurgensen argues in his article “The IRL Fetish”
				going offline has no special significance aside from the action of logging out. Rather, it is a fetishized notion that speaks
				in the interest of the apparatus:
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				Facebook doesn’t curtail the offline but depends on it. What is most crucial to our time spent logged on is what happened
				when logged off; it is the fuel that runs the engine of social media. The photos posted, the opinions expressed, the check-ins
				that fill our streams are often anchored by what happens when disconnected and logged off. <span class="highlight">
					The Web has everything to do with
				reality; it comprises real people with real bodies, histories, and politics. It is the fetish objects of the offline and the
				disconnected that are not real.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				Facebook depends on content production based in physical space, in “real life,” to keep its stream of content going. Not only
				that, but it needs this stream to refer to the commodity interests of its users, so that its business based in targeted
				advertising and corporate deals can continue. The fetishization of the disconnection is not based in an actual desire for
				authenticity, but an idea of authenticity related to the historical desire for uniqueness and specialness of personal identity.
				The popularized accounts of connection through disconnection are as Jurgensen states, “merely an attempt to construct their
				own personal time-outs as more special, as allowing them to rise above those social forces of distraction that have ensnared
				the masses. ‘I am real. I am the thoughtful human. You are the automaton.’” It is a stigma similar to that of the “poser,” a
				person who claims a certain identity but in the eyes of others fails to attain it due to a lack of knowledge or status. These
				anxieties are not about safety or staticness, but of the fear of a loss of uniqueness and personal significance in a space
				where we see everyone else doing everything all the time. Unplugging advocate Sherry Turkle writes, “Once we remove ourselves
				from the flow of physical, messy, untidy life [...] we become
less willing to get out there and take a chance.”,<sup>15</sup>
				Yet the other major diagnosis appearing in media is just the opposite: FOMO, or the fear of missing out, is a shaming of the
				new generation’s unwillingness to commit for fear of passing up the chance for something better.
			</p>

			<p>
				So we see that there really is no basis for a dystopic, <i>Wall-E</i> vision for the future, but rather a new space for ego-based
				anxieties and desires to manifest. Desire of any sort has of course, the potential for commodification and profit. To obtain
				a certain status one often has to appear so: as though one has already mastered and inhabited the status one claims. In the
				case of unplugging, how will anyone notice you were offline if you do not blog about it later? It makes sense then that many
				are taking advantage of the trend of equating analog aesthetics to specialness: Instagram and its vintage style filters, toy
				typewriters and record players, and the virality of the video entitled “I Forgot My Phone”<sup>16</sup> filmed by Charlene
				deGuzman, who uses her various web presences to promote herself as an actress, are all such examples. The irony is of course
				that many of these products and messages are spread online.

				Fortunately, there are a variety of social media platforms, and many people use multiple platforms for slightly different
				purposes. I find that the social media platform as apparatus is not only the least transparent, but also the site of the
				greatest potential for the development and reclaiming of virtual locales, and for understanding life that is lived in several
				spaces simultaneously. This is in part due to the mass amount of digital natives that grow up with these platforms throughout
				their adolescence. Additionally I find that the platforms that accentuate their own weakness and offer more freedom to the
				user, are the places where we see values around authenticity being removed and replaced by new cultural judgments that are in
				part a result of a collective embracing of the contradictions of life in these multiple spaces: a preference for the fantastic.

				In this section it is my goal to look more meticulously into the performance of personality on social media platforms,
				particularly by younger digital natives, who spend a large portion of their time online. Before I begin to delve into specific
				examples of identity performance via the Internet, I would like to address questions about the reasons why what a bunch of
				teenagers are doing online are so important. What does this mean for all of us?
			</p>

			<p>
				Just as we have seen productive appropriation happen in online communities &mdash; the reclaiming of commercial spaces for social
				communication, and the transformation of language &mdash; the root of all of these actions are based upon the collective action of
				individuals that form the community as producer-consumers and poster-viewers. The formations of what we know in the sense of
				broader, cultural knowledge work in similar ways. The attitudes surrounding moral and ethical values are largely to do with
				how a generation is brought up: its environment, its education by the generations before it, and how its members coexist with
				each other. Media in all its forms, for Dazai’s adolescent character in the ‘30s as books and in contemporary times as the
				weak, digital image, invade every area of the environment, how we gain knowledge of the past, and how we interact with our
				peers. There is no culture that is created from nothing, just as there is no individual who lives free of influence.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite the potential spectacular dangers contained in the technical image and apparatus, I believe that now there is a
				large population of people who have the accompanying knowledge to divert the spectacle, and despite the Internet’s
				commercial nature, have the ability to investigate and use it for more socially productive purposes. That population most
				likely consists of those who work professionally with the various apparatuses and images, media theorists, and the digital
				natives who have grown up with and learned their way around these fragmented spaces naturally. It is this natural learning
				process, free of self-righteousness and the contemporary equivalent to “street smarts” where we see the laying of new ground
				for these productive appropriations to take place. What I will attempt to tackle while investigating this demographic on the
				individual scale, is the question of what kinds of values will emerge from a generation’s time spent online as much as offline.

				Previously, I used an example from A-culture, a community built on a still extant but relatively older model of social media.
				Using the basic design of a forum, sites where A-culture thrives are made up of a mass of anonymous users who can contribute
				short posts in certain categories. The resulting comments are ignited by the content, not typically involving the identity of
				the users themselves aside from what reputation they have in the forums. In that sense, image use on sites like 4chan and
				Something Awful are completely dissimilar to personal blogging sites like Livejournal, the original iterations of Myspace and
				Xanga, and more popular social networks like Facebook, Tumblr, or Twitter, where content is generated from a self-centric
				perspective. On these sites, users post content on an individual account that is attributed to only one person, rather than
				topical threads that exist side by side.
￼
			</p>

			<div class="left">
				<img src="imgs/firstmet.png" /><br/>
				<span class="caption">
					A remnant of deleted information on Facebook
				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				In the case of these platforms, the content posted is always indexed to one person. Everything posted becomes a marker
				of that user’s personal identity. On Facebook this is taken to the extreme as the site’s algorithms constantly beckon for
				personal data to be added and kept in its database. What do you look like? Who are your friends? When did you complete school?
				What are you eating, drinking, watching, feeling?
			</p>

			<p>
				As a blogging platform, Tumblr is actually a departure from its predecessors. Unlike Facebook, user identities are not
				required to relate to a presence in physical space. Not only is total anonymity allowed, but the site’s design directly
				encourages you to post content that is not yours using a system of “reblogging.” Similar to Twitter’s system of retweeting,
				Tumblr users express themselves most often by sharing posts which can aggregate hundreds of thousands of reblogs and likes,
				choosing whether to add their own voice to the post or not. And while Twitter is a “microblogging” platform, constraining
				media and prioritizing 140 characters of text, Tumblr is highly suited for posting images and allowing you to customize the
				layout and how you would like them displayed. This method of blogging encourages less original content because of both
its
				ease of use, and the inherent popularity of content that more people can relate to.
			</p>

			<p>
				Tumblr also takes cues from A-culture, allowing expressive anonymity. Not only does Tumblr allow you to change your alias
				at any time, but it also allows you to create multiple blogs that are all accessed from the same account. This makes it
				easy to create and manage several blogs that are targeted towards specific purposes or audiences simultaneously. In its
				pre-Yahoo buyout stage, in the A-culture tradition, any and all images were allowed, with no regards to copyright,
				pornography or general distastefulness<sup>17</sup>. This combination of encouraged appropriation and anonymity makes it
				only possible to understand someone through a collective image made up of a collection of posts. The performance of the image
				is dependent on the performances of the images around it, giving context to who a particular user is.
			</p>

			<p>
				In light of these platforms’ differences, Facebook is in a way representative of Debord’s observations about the
				post-industrial economy’s effect on our social lives. Facebook, with its former exclusivity to university affiliations and
				constant requests for real information, is very much concerned with what you appear to have: have in the sense of both
				ownership and experience. Tumblr, on the other hand, is removed from Facebook on another level as well. It no longer matters
				what we appear to have, but what we appear we would like to have. A person’s identity is not necessarily associated to actual
				claimed possessions, but to their personal taste: their style, what jokes they think are funny, their aspirations and what
				they would like to own, look like, eat, or do. And because posts are so easily seen and shared, the Tumblr blog is often a
				more revealing and honest mirror of identity than is apparent. The Tumblr-persona however, due to its aspirational nature,
				is much more vague than the personas portrayed on other user- centric platforms.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another social media platform, DeviantArt (commonly abbreviated as dA) is an art community website meant for artists to
				display their own work, take commissions, and leave text-based critiques for each other. Launched in 2000, it is one of the
				largest online art communities, housing millions of members that range from preteen amateur illustrators to professional
				photographers. As would be expected from an arts website, originality and creativity are prized principles, made clear in
				the inclusion of the word “deviant” in its branding strategy, which also serves as the title for each member. This attitude
				of embracing eccentricity has also generated a large membership of fandom-based users who identify with the ever popular
				otaku subculture or other groups who consider themselves marginal.
			</p>

			<p>
				Knowing these facts about dA, it is no surprise then that it has a large database of “my room” photographs. From studying a
				large sample of these photographs, one can begin to see similarities in how these rooms are presented and how the remaining
				variable aspects become the telling points of the person behind the picture. First, more often than not, the picture includes
				at least two walls and the presence of the bed. These signal that this is in fact, a personal bedroom. Second, the photographs
				can be categorized into those that are displaying an aesthetic versus a collection. On dA, it is very likely that a “my room”
				photograph is primarily meant for exhibiting an accumulation of objects pertaining to a certain interest, and that the
				aesthetic of the room itself is only a byproduct of the mass. As a result, this clutter aesthetic has become a
characteristic
				of the obsessed otaku, though not a defining one. Despite its clutter however, the contents are usually at least in part, made
				purposefully visible.

				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				The shift from portrayal through having to portrayal through sharing is evident through the “my room” image. Posting
				pictures of your bedroom has been a technique of self-sharing that occurs on almost every platform, as it is a gesture
				that allows viewers to enter an extremely intimate and personal space, while also providing the safety of constraining the
				framing and the angle. In 2013 I attempted to collect as many pictures tagged or labeled as “my room” as possible for the
				purpose of exploring the similarities and disparities of what these users choose to reveal<sup>18</sup>. The variation in
				this collection expands past anime and other otaku genre fandoms into other general interests, each revealing its own aesthetic
				that pertains to a certain style or taste. Some photographer deviants may have a collection of framed classic photographs or
				magazine pages. Others may have a collection of music related merchandise. On occasion you will see a blank wall and bed,
				either proof of someone who has just moved or a symbol of the artist’s devotion to simplicity.

					17 While adult content and other inappropriate content is still rampant on Tumblr at this point in time, Yahoo has begun to

				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				On Tumblr you find a similar enthusiasm for sharing bedroom images. However, there is an additional category: many of the
				images tagged as “my room” are not the poster’s room at all but of ambiguous origin. Rather than being a documentation of a
				room that they own, the tag is used as an implication of “my room in the future” or “my dream room.” As there is no actual
				ownership involved, these rooms are typically of the general aesthetic category, taken in high quality, featuring some
				particular decoration
point that is interest-neutral, such as fairy lights. The linguistic slip between user and metadata—the
				use of “my” when there is no “me” involved—highlights the transition between having-being and sharing-being.
			</p>

			<p>
				For any social media platform, the interaction between a user and their virtual spaces is not one-directional: the feedback
				loop of the technical image works here as well. In the case of Tumblr, a user-specific “dashboard” aggregates all posts by
				followed blogs into one timeline. This feature allows users to create a circle of friends and interests that essentially
				forms a worldview that they can selectively share from and interact with. The mass collecting of aspirational images and
				community-specific knowledge ultimately, with enough dedication, reflects back into physical spaces where those friends can
				be contacted, those products bought, and jokes shared with others. Tumblr’s more enthusiastic users are well aware of the
				site’s effects on their lives outside of the website, and how Tumblr to them serves not only as a leisure space but one that
				has the potential to manifest in physical life. This happens as commercial participation, but also in psychological assessments
				of the physical environment and self. As user plasticpony reveals to Hyperallergic, “If someone can take a look at my Tumblr
				and say ‘I like it,’ I feel happy. Because looking at my blog is very similar to looking directly inside my brain. If I can be
				accepted on Tumblr, maybe I can also accept myself.”<sup>19</sup>

			<p>
				As plasticpony’s comment seems to suggest, social media platforms such as Tumblr are not only places to promote self-image,
				but also to explore them. To an adolescent, these virtual spaces provide an opportunity to separate certain contexts from
				others. Using a variety of platforms and accounts, several different personalities and special interests can be pursued and
				performed without the same pressures that are present in physical spaces and interactions. Tumblr’s multiple blog feature is
				especially exemplary in its allowance of prismatic identity creation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Creating personas, online or not, is a natural inclination that nevertheless consumes a lot of time and effort. In physical
				spaces, certain personas are displayed constantly in a stream of events tied to the individual’s bodily presence around others.
				Online however, images perform only when they are opened and viewed. Consequently, on social networks, where your posts are
				equalized and placed alongside content from your entire network, identity performance has to be maintained over long periods,

emulating your bodily presence. And because your online persona is not constrained to place and time, interest must be
				maintained through consistent updates.
			</p>

			<p>
				This feat is not only for the benefit of others, but also for the poster: self-worth and self-fulfillment as a psychological
				and evolutionary goal is evaluated through a constant comparison to others and to one’s past self. Through constant comparison,
				an individual can understand one’s own role within a community and the progress of personal development within it. This
				constant comparison of self with surroundings is similar to the visual process of interpreting what Sianne Ngai calls the
				“interesting” aesthetic, which “marks a tension between the unknown and already known and is generally bound up with a
				desire to know and document reality.”<sup>20</sup> Certainly, this constant desire to be seen as interesting in its varying
				gradations &mdash; stylish, cool, fashionable, etc. &mdash; is consistent with this definition, as to be perceived as any of these things
				requires a balance between novel and relatable, familiar yet just unconventional enough to inspire a feeling of admirable
				uniqueness. It is also this balance between established and unorthodox that, as Ngai also notes, binds interestingness to
				photography and its technical qualities. Just as “interesting” as an evaluation is weak, so is the indiscriminate nature of
				the photograph, which according to Susan Sontag has the power to make everything in the world appear interesting through
				the camera’s frame, and to level every photograph to the judgment of more or less interesting rather than good or bad<sup>21</sup>.
				Nowhere else is this indiscriminateness more apparent than the social media-bound snapshot.
			</p>

			<p>
				And like other aspects of virtual life, this indiscriminate quality bleeds into physical life, portrayed in the fashion trend
				termed “normcore,” a style based in the vaguely outdated ‘90s aesthetic, a la background characters in the animated MTV series
				<i>Daria</i>. Despite Fiona Duncan’s argument that it is “a look designed to play well with others,”<sup>22</sup> it is not
				a style dedicated to normality or approachability at all but an application of the vagueness of ownership and interestingness
				found online to the bodily presence. It is the establishment of a neutral (not normal) look that evades concerns of social
				belonging while still managing to appear interesting via its comparison with the current normal. Perhaps it is a
				counterreaction to the ‘90s preoccupation with cultural posers and anxieties about whether you are “in” or “out.” Just as
				Ngai connects the interesting aesthetic to the motion of information circulation, normcore aims to keep up with virtual
				speeds by balancing on the edge between outdated and current, taking advantage of the indiscriminate boundaries Sontag
				describes in photography. And even more fitting with the online image, normcore itself is not a style that was invented or
				designed, but one that was coined by others.

				Online, comments, likes, and quantitative attentiveness are a literal translation of one’s interestingness over time. The
				instant-reward qualities of social networks make the appeal of self-comparison obvious. The feedback response of post and
				receive and the quantifiable comparison to previous posts is so addicting that everything suddenly becomes interesting when
				framed effectively: what we eat, where we are, what we wear, even our faces. However, online narcissism is not so much an act
				of self-adoration as much as an obsession with self-customization. As Clément Rosset explains in his book <i>The Real and
				the Double</i>, narcissism is not a love tied to a corporeal existence of self but to the representation of the self that is
				built by the self. The trend of the selfie may not be so much of an act of self love but a love of the act of
				self-representation and the potential confirmations of interestingness that follow its publication.
			</p>

			<div class="left">

			<p>
				If there is love in self-representation, it does not require that love to exist in the original. As plasticpony admits,
				becoming accepted, loved, and revered online holds the potential for allowing acceptance, love, and reverence for herself.
				Her feelings for her projected representation are not at all connected to her physical self which is needed to create it.
				Her interest is based on the psychological image-turned-technical image: her aspirational self, not the self tied to
				physical limitations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Again, this is where the apparatus has a particular effect on the way we view ourselves. On platforms based on the timeline
				format, posts are implicitly situated as reflective. For platforms like Tumblr and Pinterest, content is fragmented, not
				chronologically based, and can act as reflective or projective, or in some cases both. What the Internet allows is for the
				formation of a personal hierarchy of selves that may include the now-self on Facebook or Twitter, the fictional self that
				belongs in a MMORPG or other avatar, the aesthetic-driven aspirational self on Tumblr, or interest-driven self on a forum.
				It is in virtual spaces where these hierarchies can be freely rearranged and contrasted, and it is in the most unrestrained
				spaces that there is freedom for completely new values to be created.

				In some cases, more extreme embodiments of culture bred online manifest in physical spaces more abruptly than physical societies
				are ready to handle. Despite adverse reactions, these manifestations are the result of consistent exposure to imagery and participation
				in cultures that are aspirational beyond physical means. It makes sense then that it is on Tumblr, where curated and dissected desires
				prevail, that terms such as “otherkin,” “fictives,” “transethnics,” and their combinations into “multiple systems” gain ground.
				These self-created terms refer to groups of people who feel a fundamental wrongness in their human bodies. Though their desired
				physicalities differ, they all share the same longing for a different kind of physical existence altogether.
			</p>

			<p>
				These claimed identities are products of knowledge gained and absorbed online. Fictives believe that they are in fact fictional
				characters created by others, encased in a human body. Similarly, otherkin believe that they are spiritually and psychologically
				animals, who have unfortunately been born into human bodies. In a documentary interview segment by SBS2 Australia, Laura, a
				self-identified dog-wolf hybrid otherkin is shown scrolling through Facebook and slideshows of wolves. She states: “I haven’t actually
				spent any time around live wolves. I study them a lot, their diet, their body structure, so I can understand myself better.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Her spiritual affinity for wolves is not a result of any physical tradition, but rather an attraction to the animals and a connection
				made on an online community. As she dons faux-fur tails and a collar her activities are clearly aspirational, though they have reached
				an extreme where the aspirational feeling disappears and the psychological effect is that of not belonging or of innate wrongness:
			</p>

			<p class="quote">
				I do get a sense of jealousy when I see wolves. Mainly for their freedom. [...] I think my spirit took human form this time mainly
				just as a mistake. But, you just have to live and get on with it because there’s no way to go back to what you were. Just basically
				live with the body you’ve got.
			</p>

			<p>
				Laura’s aspirations have gone beyond the limit of being or simply sharing. In physical space her longings are tragically unattainable.
				While the concept of spirit animals and the sexual fetishism of furries are close in subject matter, Laura seems to show an earnest
				commitment to her identity as a dog-wolf in an amazingly pure way. Whether or not it is a phase is not related to the fact that an online
				community allowed her to develop and support her interspecies persona.

Possibly the most controversial niche group are transethnics, made up of individuals who believe that they inhabit their biological
				ethnicities only at the shallow, perceptible level of the physical body, claiming to identify with a completely different geopolitical
				profile. The original use of the term transethnic was used to refer to child adoptees who are adopted by parents from a different country
				and become culturally displaced. Whether or not the term was knowingly appropriated from this context is unclear, as is the origin of
				its online context. Some theories suggest that it was intended as a mocking jab at those with transgender identities, as a satirical
				performance of their perceived absurdity, purposefully using racist comparisons to troll Tumblr’s relatively accepting space. Whether
				transethnicity emerged sincerely or not, there are convincing cases of individuals who show genuine recognition of the concept, either
				as proclaimed transethnics themselves or in their defense of someone else. As an anonymous Tumblr user argues, if she can experience being
				Japanese through online accounts, what keeps her from essentially having the same experience as a Japanese person?
			</p>

			<p>
				It is obvious that a label bred on the Internet, mostly through anonymous or semi-anonymous users claiming rights to biological and
				political features is controversial and problematic. Far from the adoptee situation, the most vocal and well-known examples of transethnics
				are Caucasian individuals who claim to actually be misplaced Japanese or Koreans. They have been accused of being trolls, racists, etc. by
				other Tumblr users and online communities. But for every example of dismissal or attack, each self-proclaimed transethnic also has a base of
				reinforcement of supporters behind them, especially in the space of Tumblr, which has a generally extreme stance on social justice that is
				simultaenously encouraged and ridiculed within the community.

			<p>
				Non-coincidentally, Japanese and Korean pop culture (comics, movies, television, music) are major “fandoms” that reach global audiences.
				For many, their fandoms are the primary and only glimpse into these other cultures, based in communities of other Internet users who approach
				their obsessions from the same displaced, second-hand point of view. It is undeniable that this sense of membership outside of the physical,
				inherent environment a person is born into now exists. It is increasingly common to find individuals who prefer their virtual community, where
				there is safety in anonymity, and rewards of acceptance and commonality come without anxiety. Knowing this, there is significant reason to
				believe then perhaps the place where one is born and the body one inhabits may actually be a mistake. While the claiming of another ethnic
				or social status is overly naïve and insensitive, it does speak to the fact that perhaps in an increasingly connected digital space, there
				is in fact a sense of privilege that accompanies being born into a particular body, even if it is a result of a grass-is-greener type of attitude.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many members of these communities are familiar or actively involved with “multiple system” personas where several identities or “headmates”
				allegedly inhabit one human body and coexist with one another, one of which may belong to the human body, one which may be a fictive, and another
				which may be an otherkin. The fact that these various communities are so eager to claim several identities at once are in my opinion less of an
				issue involving abnormality, or the manipulative nature of catfishing, but an eagerness to use a technological platform to extend beyond the
				limitations of the natural environment. That is after all, what technology has always aimed for. As Tumblr is targeted towards a younger, adolescent
				audience who is in stages of personal development, it is leveraged in order to do so. As problematic as otherkin and transethnics may seem, they are
				a niche group within a mass of online cultures that have varying degrees of awareness regarding how their worldviews are formed and their influence
				on how they position themselves in their different spaces of reality. Laura and the anonymous transethnic’s perspectives, while extreme, are somewhat
				understandable when we evaluate their interpretations in terms of the technical image, the awareness of its workings, and the implied fiction that
				comes with the viewing of a Tumblr profile.
			</p>

			<p>
				This fiction also provides the baseline context for experiencing an online space: on Tumblr there is a particular age range and degree of untruth
				expected of the person behind the blog. Similar to the Beijing sunrise example explained earlier, this claiming of alternate identity is most controversial
				when it is intended to be read as a character that is rooted to some political and/or social position in physical space. The absurdity of transethnics and
				their inclusion in multiple systems makes them offensive but fairly harmless. In other cases of what Molly Sauter coins “civic fiction,”<sup>23</sup>
				the claiming of an alternate identity for the purpose of participating in a dialogue one would otherwise not be able to, the position of fictitious identity
				in virtual space can be read as more urgently tied to physical spaces. In 2011, online panic erupted over the detainment of a Syrian-American lesbian,
				author of a then-popular blog called A Gay Girl in Damascus. Six days later after extensive media coverage and searches conducted, the author of the blog
				was revealed to actually be a 40-year old Caucasian male named Tom MacMaster, whose experience in no way resembled his online character at all. In this
				case the position of the blog on Blogspot and its framing as an accurate account of citizen journalism created a spectacle of Western perceptions regarding
				the state of Syria and its treatment of minorities. “I do not believe that I have harmed anyone &mdash; I feel that I have created an important voice for issues
				that I feel strongly about,” wrote MacMaster in an apology post. As Sauter points out, this instance of “ecstatic” media was enabled by MacMaster’s ability
				to manufacture an interesting character embedded in global controversy while being empathetically relatable. Imagine the potential reaction if MacMaster
				had written a subheading stating its fictional nature upfront.

			<p>
				Catfishing operates in a similar manner of context shifting. The act of catfishing is not so different from a common practice of online roleplaying,
				where two or more people adapt the personalities of fictional characters and interact with each other as if in their universe. While traditionally
				roleplaying is enacted through private or public text exchange, some also use social media platforms to create accounts for their characters and use those
				as a means of interacting with others who are involved or not. Harry Potter characters for example, can be seen on Facebook or Twitter, and own “ask blogs”
				on Tumblr where they respond directly to inquiries from other Tumblr users. Catfishing is in essence a non-consensual and extreme version of roleplaying,
				the only difference being its false insistence to its physical world attachments, which may draw others into a fictional premise without their approval. One
				of the most popular instances of catfishing occurred in 2012 to then college football player Manti Te’o, who
suffered the death of his girlfriend only to
				find that she had never existed. Instead, a man named Ronaiah Tuiasosopo was allegedly interested in Te’o romantically and found this to be the only method
				of achieving his desire.

				<span class="caption">

				</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				What all of these examples of identity fiction reveal is that the these multiple identities online are rooted to personal aspirations that make their
				way from and to physical spaces. In the case of Te’o and “Gay Girl in Damascus,” the attempts to falsely claim authenticity in the physical space, and
				the inability of their viewers to see through the apparatuses on which these identities were displayed led to situations where a destroyed spectacle did
				emotional damage to others. Additionally, though “Gay Girl in Damascus” was revealed in the end to be a piece of fiction, the “political work” it achieved
				in calling media attention was more than effective even if it had the unfortunate effect of perpetuating what Western media had already believed regarding
				the situation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Though these examples seem to reflect how the identities in virtual space perhaps overreach the possibilities in the physical world, these are tensions
				that arise from innate desires to at times embrace the identity of the other, seen also in the historical rehashes of a suburban youth’s dream to cast
				off privilege and lead alternative lifestyles, and in classic stories such as The Prince and the Pauper. Furthermore, each of these pieces of fictional
				identity, whether they are eventually left inactive or not, relate and build upon a person’s character as a whole. As Simondon relates in his theory of
				individuation, the “individual” is never complete but constantly going through stages of development where the individual is both a subject and a
				collective of relative experiences. In a much more superficial sense, the multiple system trend on Tumblr could be read as a literal collection and
				documentation of this process.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite the extremity and seemingly sincere assertions by otherkin and transethnics to their identities, I believe that the majority of members within
				these groups are completely conscious of the extent their fictions can go in physical spaces, but choose to commit to their online identities for their
				own personal purposes, whether it is for humor at the expense of others or to fill a need not met in physical life. Though these examples present potential
				problems of identity situated within infinite virtual variability, the possible insincerity of these identity assertions within online communities are not
				projected so haphazardly as we may believe. Rather, they are images projected within a context of implied fiction and leveraged for that environment, with
				a knowing sense that online life and physical life are as described before, fragmented, separate, but overlapping.
			</p>

			<div class="title">RISE OF THE FANTASTIC: HOW COMMUNITIES BRIDGE REALITIES</div>

			<p>
				As we see in the example of transethnics and otherkin, online spaces provide places for personality exploration to reach limits that question traditional
				values and accepted visions of normality. Commonly these are spaces where the most extreme of obsessions and fandoms are cultivated, the most widely
				spread and well known example perhaps being otaku culture, which has its foundations in Japanese manga, games, and anime. While its roots are in Japan,
				this subculture and its perceived attitudes have spread far into other cultures and countries that have interpreted it for their own motivations. In its
				various forms of translation and transference overseas, otaku culture has a large range of manifestations, some of which stay true to its traditional
				perception, while others become applied to a love of (an image of) Japanese culture in general, or specific topics in between. Some of these have become
				integrated into A-culture and other communities. What remains in its foundation is its characteristic fanaticism: in Japanese the term otaku can be applied
				to anyone with an intense obsession, not specific to animation but anything from trains to undersea creatures. This defining mania borders on social alienation,
				obtaining its history from the term “otaku” itself, derived from the awkwardly outdated and overly formal term for addressing another person.
			</p>

			<p>
				In and out of Japan, the alienating aspect of the otaku has formed a particular stigma around it based on its loosening from reality and the community’s
				asocial tendencies in general. This stigma has been blamed for several phenomena, from the child-adult behavior of hikikomori, to the 2008 Akihabara massacre.
				These features and concepts of technological self-mediation have been commonly referenced in otaku media, both seriously and jokingly. In many of these examples,
				online social media plays a major part: in the franchise for <i>Densha Otoko</i> (“Train Man”), 2chan<sup>24</sup> provides the backdrop of support and encouragement
				for a self-professed otaku’s attempt to woo a woman he meets on the train, whereas in series such as <i>Suicide Club</i> and <i>Serial Experiments Lain</i> the online
				network provides a more sinister and mysterious catalyst for reality and virtual spaces to collapse and bleed into each other.

			<p>
				While otaku culture is notorious for its attachment to the fictional and for its escapism from reality, including emotional attachments to inanimate objects
				or fictional characters and the complete avoidance of social situations, in most cases the issue of distinguishing real from fiction is nonexistent. For
				otaku, the distinction between physical and virtual is clearly understood: they have chosen to clearly prefer the latter over the former. This includes
				accepting and embracing the reputation that comes with this preference. As Auerbach states, “otaku stigma and pride are inseparable. To be an otaku is to
				willfully identify as rejected and alienated.” This is clearly visible in series that self-reference its community such as Genshiken, and in the self-deprecating
				posts that circulate on Tumblr and other gathering spaces. Furthermore, just as the social media platform requires physical events to maintain its activity,
				the otaku preference of the virtual requires a comparison to the physical: “it requires ‘reality’ as a complement to each participant’s online masque—hence
				the stigma of the otaku, for whom the life of play is realer than their real lives. A-culture derives its vitality from the otaku-like commitment its members
				bring to the masque, affirming its importance to them over their real lives.”

				</span>
			</div>

			<p>

Much of the stigma surrounding otaku culture’s apparent disconnection from real life is based on the same anxieties upon which
				the aforementioned unplugging trend is focused. It is the interpretation of otaku culture through popularized stories, not its
				actual attitude, that reflects these reputations. Saito Tamaki argues, “What otaku enjoy is not making fiction into material form.
				Nor, as is often claimed, do they derive enjoyment from confusing reality and fiction [...] We do not enjoy fiction because it is a
				form of virtual reality. We enjoy it because of its status as another reality, one that demands a rearrangement of the subject.”<sup>25</sup>
				It is this rearrangement of subject that forms the primary motivation for the otaku and teen Tumblr girl alike: the desire to
				establish a space of belonging and role of specialness within it. It is natural then that new values are created within these
				alternate realities, though they may be impeded by the commonly accepted terms for realness. In the case of the Japanese otaku,
				Diane Lewis cites an example of “the way that ‘unhealthy’ forms of consumption are projected onto specific bodies:” the discourse
				around otaku is based primarily around men despite evidence that the most active fans are actually female. To Lewis, it is an issue
				regarding “The question of who adjudicates the distinction between fantasy and reality, and how, is perhaps at the crux of moral
				panics over immoderate media consumption.”
			</p>

			<div class="right">
			<span id="footnote">
				25 As quoted by Diane Lewis in "Media Fantasies and Moral Panics."
			</span>
			</div>

			<p>
				This is a question that I believe should be considered in the context of online sociability in general and applied to the opacity
				of the online apparatus. Otaku culture in itself has in recent times become increasingly popular, finding its way into American
				pop culture both online and off. I believe that the increasingly mainstream otaku attitudes combined with the aesthetic and
				mechanical designs of Tumblr have a large part in how we perceive these boundaries between physical and virtual and how we may
				treat them in the future. In part, I predict that the distinctions between these two spaces will collapse even further, but not
				into the commonly imagined dystopic confusion. Instead, it will cause societal shifts in value judgments and perceptions of
				privilege. Rather than questions of “who is the real me?” it will be demands of “why can’t this be me?” that enter our physical
				spaces and provide the fuel for invention of technology and commodity, cultural aesthetics, and changing social values. And it
				is this perspective that allows us to avoid spectacular dystopia in favor of a world that is fantastic, where alternate realities
				coexist and are understood in relation to one another.

			<div class="title" id="conclusion">conclusion</div>

			<p>
				Throughout this book I have argued several different scenarios in regard to how online vision and interpretation affect our
				physical (traditional) perceptions of reality, and how the awareness of that image and its usage in identity performance gives
				us the potential to reconfigure our environments based on new cultural aesthetics and the value judgments that accompany them.
				Our understanding of the digital image has empowered us to not only avoid the perils of a spectacular society, but also to build
				complex, distinct cultures on both planes of physical and virtual existence. As long as we are conscious of our new space, its
				context and its implications, we have the ability to keep our autonomy within a place that only poses as democratic.
			</p>

			<p>
				The takeaway I would like to impart is not a promotion of either side of our contemporary physical-virtual life, but to assure
				that, even if we do spend the majority of our days online connected through screens, everything is alright. While there are
				problems on the Internet, they are for the most part iterations of the usual questions humanity encounters trying to figure out
				a place in a universe that only grows larger as we try to master it.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am, however, optimistic in this new hybrid life. I have faith in my generation’s knack for sarcasm and irony, and its nostalgic
				grip on the past to flourish in our new commercially driven environment. I believe that the Internet will allow cultures of
				fantasy, based on special interests and proud appropriation of virtual freedom, to cause societal shifts in values and etiquette
				that can be put to use in non-virtual spaces. There will be missteps and feelings hurt as always, but how they affect us in the
				long run is just another progression for humanity to adopt, adapt, or abandon.
			</p>

			<p>
				As Sherrie Rabinowitz said of satellite video, “[the image]
becomes the real architecture for the performance because the image
				is a place. It’s a real place and your image is your ambassador, and two ambassadors meet in the image.” As we send our
				ambassadors into increasingly convoluted image places, it is likely that they will return with equally complex visions of the
				world. But as long as we are aware of their magic, we can use them to build upon the fantastic utopia in which we already live.

			<div id="web" class="title">about this thesis</div>
			<p>
				The original version of this thesis was written in 2014 in partial fulfillment for a Masters of Fine Arts in Digital + Media at
				Rhode Island School of Design, and printed on-demand as a traditional book. Post-graduation I decided to use the format of a
				website to provide an environment for my thesis closer to where it originates from: the internet. I am aware that the topics that
				I cover in this writing are vast and largely incomplete. My intention is to use this website as a dynamic basis for my future projects.
				I encourage anyone who reads it to respond and give me feedback (for now by <a href="mailto:janet@moriandyama.com">email</a>) and
				to schedule periodic revisits as its format allows it to change almost as quickly as the content on the Internet does. In the future,
				I hope to be able to integrate immediate feedback features.
