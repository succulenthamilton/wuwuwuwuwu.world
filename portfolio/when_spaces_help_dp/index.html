<p>Humans fluctuate between their need for control and their need for direction and repetition. The creation of such a space lies in creating a malleable yet structured space. It also requires a healthy psychological understanding of our body, boundaries and space.</p>
<p>
Within our inhabited spaces, the parts you can't change, or won't allow yourself to change, becomes environment space, a space you accept as reality. The mind knows the rules and leaves the environment space alone. Having these kinds of awareness feeds into your expectations and creates a mental map for this space. These mental rules are then applied to exploration and understanding new environments.<sup>1</sup><!--add footnote element!-->

<p>
When something becomes clearly out of our control, the actions we affect on the space seems futile and predetermined. As the theory of regression in frustration explains through an experiment, a child who is moved to another area during playtime suffers from crippling displacement. The effet of this disruption affected both the child's long-term goal setting and his/her relationship with the space. The visible connection between his expectations and the affected reality grows eaker and lessens his invested effort in growing the space.<sup>2</sup><!--more footnote-->

<p>
With this degree project I'm proposing a new kind of self help. It's an object / space-based help. The guide comes from the outside in and reinvigorates our relationship with our environment.

So remove the gloss warp off your brand new product, sand off that sterile polish, grind off the edges off your iPhone and make it work to your needs. Our agency only exists in face of a possibility to change.

            One of the main things that I have been wondering about is how one can actually live a "liberated" life, or if this is even possible. My idea right now is that perhaps the only real way to liberate oneself is to slip in between the cracks of larger authoritative systems... often <span class="highlight">we do this by making smaller, more enclosed systems that are even more restrictive than those in the outside world.</span> You can become so cocooned in these little self-invented structures that you almost believe the larger systems don't actually exist anymore.

    <p>I've always had a hard time at taking control and care of the objects I own and the spaces that I inhabit. I'm unable to deal with my things and make decisions about their place in my life. Things all have the same weight on my mind, playing the intimidation game with my bed, full of chunks, scrap thoughts, note- books, chewed-out pens, clothes I've worn once and have become one giant visible trail of life waste that followed my body as it slowly gave out bits and pieces of living. The pile, made of pieces with names, is nameless together. It’s just a "misc pile". There's no ownership to its mass like when I spoke the name of the Poland Spring bottled water.</p>
<p>
Where does it go? Things struggle to find home on surfaces that visually detests anything but the pristine. The clothing that you've worn once are not dirty enough for washing but aren’t clean enough to be put back on the hangers. The cup containing the lukewarm coffee. Jars of your pens and bits. A calculator and a rubber band. Business cards. Post-its from day and years before. Your works-in-progresses. To-do lists, recipes, hopes and dreams. These items are relatively harmless in small amounts but when neglected will quickly began to eat away at your.</p>
    <p>
Every act of organization is a forced restart, proposing again and again another impossible version of clean. Can I find stasis in this loop of failure? Some path of least resistance that encourages an ordered chaos? Is it me?
Thankfully, you are not the problem (at least not entirely). You are not the problem, it’s the space and the external environment that’s preventing change.</p>

				My generation is one of natives to a digital landscape where much of our adolescence and development has come from time
				spent online rather than in backyards or parks or elsewhere. They &mdash; as in the media and its representatives &mdash; like to write
				about me and the seemingly alienated way I live. They scold me for my lack of commitment to a career and to relationships,
				and for my constant use of electronic devices. Everything rooted in analog traditions and physical presence, they say, is going
				to shit.

The concept of an ideal space is appealling. We are invigorated by its possiblity. It as the perfect solution. The fix for all of our organization and lifestyle problems. The ultimate goal is for the user to be comfortably in control. It’s a space tailored to a human-scaled living, more specifically, to a user. Of course, this idealized space cannot happen without input from the user. The whole creation of this space is through a constant feedback loop between the user and his/her space.
</p>

<p>
This idealized space keeps everything contained and everything relevant highlighted. Nothing is lost in deep storage, misplaced and forgotten, nor are things left too active, stimuli alive and buzzing. Within the space, its objects are mobile and customizable, the pieces stay relative to me. The system inte- grates within a life, my life.
</p>

<p>
It’s part of the physical toolkit to free you from whatever hangups you have with making rough with the things you own. When things are too unstructured we ask for space for help. When things become too sterile and structured we tear down the pieces down and mold them to our needs. On a bigger level,
it advocates you to truly know your objects and spaces - take it apart beyond the layers of seemingly magical fabrication manufacturing methods and reclaim your agency to do.
</p>
<p>
The key is to have a continuous feedback loop between the user and the space. There’s a state of relatively stable homeostatis. Yet the space never stops regulating. This is a moving ideal.

    Life Station is the establishment of a system.</p>
    <p>
It's a home base where you arrange your priorities in order of what is in visual, spatial and mental proximity to you.
    </p>
    <p>
It deals with clutter by visually masking it, physically limiting the space, and keeping the storage and interactions transitory and not permenant.

    The implications of this work lies in creating a mental state of mind that would encour- age a healthy lifestyle, whatever version of healthy may mean to you. The pieces were ultimately a part of an instructional toolkit that would enable people like myself to take ownership of my space and overcome my inability to react to the world around me. Just telling people to “deal with it” is not a method of effective repair. We are creatures of comfort, only when we are pushed do we begin to make change. We shape our bodies to the crevices that will fit us only when we know it’s our own or when we have no other choice. Now it’s possible to be in charge of that environment and indeed help yourself.
