<!--p>Humans fluctuate between their need for control and their need for direction and repetition. The creation of such a space lies in creating a malleable yet structured space. It also requires a healthy psychological understanding of our body, boundaries and space.
<br>
Within our inhabited spaces, the parts you can't change, or won't allow yourself to change, becomes environment space, a space you accept as reality. The mind knows the rules and leaves the environment space alone. Having these kinds of awareness feeds into your expectations and creates a mental map for this space. These mental rules are then applied to exploration and understanding new environments.<sup>1</sup><!--add footnote element!-->
<!--br>
When something becomes clearly out of our control, the actions we affect on the space seems futile and predetermined. As the theory of regression in frustration explains through an experiment, a child who is moved to another area during playtime suffers from crippling displacement. The effet of this disruption affected both the child's long-term goal setting and his/her relationship with the space. The visible connection between his expectations and the affected reality grows eaker and lessens his invested effort in growing the space.<sup>2</sup><!--more footnote-->

With this degree project I'm proposing a new kind of self help. It's an object / space-based help. The guide comes from the outside in and reinvigorates our relationship with our environment.

So remove the gloss warp off your brand new product, sand off that sterile polish, grind off the edges off your iPhone and make it work to your needs. Our agency only exists in face of a possibility to change.
