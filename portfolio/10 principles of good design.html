<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><span style="-evernote-last-insertion-point:true;"/>Good design is human-scaled. Its use and approach comes directly from human need in both a physical and emotional sense.This bathroom aid understands the needs directly from a human-scale and everything else comes after. The cubit is a standard of measurement used by the Ancient egyptians. it’s the distance from the fingertips to the elbow and dictated the size of designed things. Designed things extrapolated its scale from these measurements. The objects that arised from need for efficient production, such as a default 6ft piece of cardboard, is not configured to the human body at all.  </span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Good design is “fun”. Good design doesn’t take itself too seriously. It never goes all the way in any direction to educate particularly due to our postmodern erosion of any distinct stubbornness to an ideal or belief. There is a certain lightheartedness in its concept or the making process that avoids sterility and heavy-handedness of an “important” project.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Good design is selective. It actively pursues one set of priorities.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Good design get along with each other. Good things come in packages. When designed things work, it’s because they work with other things in your life.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Good design speaks your language, but shouts it constantly. And when everything works together, it starts to speak one language, hopefully your language. This creates a safe consistency that gives some semblance of permanence to the every changing chaos of daily life.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Good design is instructive. There is an element of self-help in good design. They want to be a positive/negative reinforcement in your life. This can materialize either in the form of a firm whisper or a slap in the face. Good design doesn’t tell you how to live your life, it manipulates you towards it. It tries to prescribe a certain way of use and lifestyle. This feels good because you trust the experts.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Good design can be anything. On the flipside, you can totally disregarded its original use. The possibility to reinterpret a design depends on your willingness and its adaptability.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Good design has hierarchy. There are clear and conscious levels of hierarchy within the design. They come pre structured and organized so you don’t have to.</span></p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.15;"><span style="font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Good design must communicate. This is the most important thing. Good design successfully communicates an idea, a story, a curiosity, a need, a context, a whatever gesture that needs to be communicated. When it travels to the next person it doesn’t need to be read exactly as intended but it should have some hint of the gesture that reads with the same impact.</span></p>
